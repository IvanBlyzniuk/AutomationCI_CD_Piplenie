9.
I stop trying to sleep after my first few attempts are
interrupted by unspeakable nightmares. After that, I just lie
still and do fake breathing whenever someone checks on
me. In the morning, I'm released from the hospital and
instructed to take it easy. Cressida asks me to record a
few lines for a new Mockingjay propo. At lunch, I keep
waiting for people to bring up Peeta's appearance, but no
one does. Someone must have seen it besides Finnick
and me.
I have training, but Gale's scheduled to work with
Beetee on weapons or something, so I get permission to
take Finnick to the woods. We wander around awhile and
then ditch our communicators under a bush. When we're a
safe distance away, we sit and discuss Peeta's broadcast.
"I haven't heard one word about it. No one's told you
anything?" Finnick says. I shake my head. He pauses
before he asks, "Not even Gale?" I'm clinging to a shred of
hope that Gale honestly knows nothing about Peeta's
message. But I have a bad feeling he does. "Maybe he's
trying to find a time to tell you privately."
"Maybe," I say.
We stay silent so long that a buck wanders into range. I
take it down with an arrow. Finnick hauls it back to the
fence.
For dinner, there's minced venison in the stew. Gale
walks me back to Compartment E after we eat. When I ask
him what's been going on, again there's no mention of
Peeta. As soon as my mother and sister are asleep, I slip
the pearl from the drawer and spend a second sleepless
night clutching it in my hand, replaying Peeta's words in my
head. "Ask yourself, do you really trust the people you're
working with? Do you really know what's going on? And if
you don't...find out." Find out. What? From who? And how
can Peeta know anything except what the Capitol tells him?
It's just a Capitol propo. More noise. But if Plutarch thinks
it's just the Capitol line, why didn't he tell me about it? Why
hasn't anyone let me or Finnick know?
Under this debate lies the real source of my distress:
Peeta. What have they done to him? And what are they
doing to him right now? Clearly, Snow did not buy the story
that Peeta and I knew nothing about the rebellion. And his
suspicions have been reinforced, now that I have come out
as the Mockingjay. Peeta can only guess about the rebel
tactics or make up things to tell his torturers. Lies, once
discovered, would be severely punished. How abandoned
by me he must feel. In his first interview, he tried to protect
me from the Capitol and rebels alike, and not only have I
failed to protect him, I've brought down more horrors upon
him.
Come morning, I stick my forearm in the wall and stare
groggily at the day's schedule. Immediately after breakfast,
I am slated for Production. In the dining hall, as I down my
hot grain and milk and mushy beets, I spot a communicuff
on Gale's wrist. "When did you get that back, Soldier
Hawthorne?" I ask.
"Yesterday. They thought if I'm going to be in the field
with you, it could be a backup system of communication,"
says Gale.
No one has ever offered me a communicuff. I wonder,
if I asked for one, would I get it? "Well, I guess one of us
has to be accessible," I say with an edge to my voice.
"What's that mean?" he says.
"Nothing. Just repeating what you said," I tell him. "And
I totally agree that the accessible one should be you. I just
hope I still have access to you as well."
Our eyes lock, and I realize how furious I am with Gale.
That I don't believe for a second that he didn't see Peeta's
propo. That I feel completely betrayed that he didn't tell me
about it. We know each other too well for him not to read
my mood and guess what has caused it.
"Katniss--" he begins. Already the admission of guilt is
in his tone.
I grab my tray, cross to the deposit area, and slam the
dishes onto the rack. By the time I'm in the hallway, he's
caught up with me.
"Why didn't you say something?" he asks, taking my
arm.
"Why didn't I?" I jerk my arm free. "Why didn't you,
Gale? And I did, by the way, when I asked you last night
about what had been going on!"
"I'm sorry. All right? I didn't know what to do. I wanted to
tell you, but everyone was afraid that seeing Peeta's propo
would make you sick," he says.
"They were right. It did. But not quite as sick as you
lying to me for Coin." At that moment, his communicuff
starts beeping. "There she is. Better run. You have things to
tell her."
For a moment, real hurt registers on his face. Then
cold anger replaces it. He turns on his heel and goes.
Maybe I have been too spiteful, not given him enough time
to explain. Maybe everyone is just trying to protect me by
lying to me. I don't care. I'm sick of people lying to me for
my own good. Because really it's mostly for their own good.
Lie to Katniss about the rebellion so she doesn't do
anything crazy. Send her into the arena without a clue so we
can fish her out. Don't tell her about Peeta's propo because
it might make her sick, and it's hard enough to get a decent
performance out of her as it is.
I do feel sick. Heartsick. And too tired for a day of
production. But I'm already at Remake, so I go in. Today, I
discover, we will be returning to District 12. Cressida wants
to do unscripted interviews with Gale and me throwing light
on our demolished city.
"If you're both up for that," says Cressida, looking
closely at my face.
"Count me in," I say. I stand, uncommunicative and
stiff, a mannequin, as my prep team dresses me, does my
hair, and dabs makeup on my face. Not enough to show,
only enough to take the edge off the circles under my
sleepless eyes.
Boggs escorts me down to the Hangar, but we don't
talk beyond a preliminary greeting. I'm grateful to be spared
another exchange about my disobedience in 8, especially
since his mask looks so uncomfortable.
At the last moment, I remember to send a message to
my mother about my leaving 13, and stress that it won't be
dangerous. We board a hovercraft for the short ride to 12
and I'm directed to a seat at a table where Plutarch, Gale,
and Cressida are poring over a map. Plutarch's brimming
with satisfaction as he shows me the before/after effects of
the first couple of propos. The rebels, who were barely
maintaining a foothold in several districts, have rallied. They
have actually taken 3 and 11--the latter so crucial since it's
Panem's main food supplier--and have made inroads in
several other districts as well.
"Hopeful. Very hopeful indeed," says Plutarch.
"Fulvia's going to have the first round of We Remember
spots ready tonight, so we can target the individual districts
with their dead. Finnick's absolutely marvelous."
"It's painful to watch, actually," says Cressida. "He
knew so many of them personally."
"That's what makes it so effective," says Plutarch.
"Straight from the heart. You're all doing beautifully. Coin
could not be more pleased."
Gale didn't tell them, then. About my pretending not to
see Peeta and my anger at their cover-up. But I guess it's
too little, too late, because I still can't let it go. It doesn't
matter. He's not speaking to me, either.
It's not until we land in the Meadow that I realize
Haymitch isn't among our company. When I ask Plutarch
about his absence, he just shakes his head and says, "He
couldn't face it."
"Haymitch? Not able to face something? Wanted a
day off, more likely," I say.
"I think his actual words were 'I couldn't face it without a
bottle,'" says Plutarch.
I roll my eyes, long out of patience with my mentor, his
weakness for drink, and what he can or can't confront. But
about five minutes after my return to 12, I'm wishing I had a
bottle myself. I thought I'd come to terms with 12's demise--
heard of it, seen it from the air, and wandered through its
ashes. So why does everything bring on a fresh pang of
grief? Was I simply too out of it before to fully register the
loss of my world? Or is it the look on Gale's face as he
takes in the destruction on foot that makes the atrocity feel
brand-new?
Cressida directs the team to start with me at my old
house. I ask her what she wants me to do. "Whatever you
feel like," she says. Standing back in my kitchen, I don't feel
like doing anything. In fact, I find myself focusing up at the
sky--the only roof left--because too many memories are
drowning me. After a while, Cressida says, "That's fine,
Katniss. Let's move on."
Gale doesn't get off so easily at his old address.
Cressida films him in silence for a few minutes, but just as
he pulls the one remnant of his previous life from the ashes-
-a twisted metal poker--she starts to question him about his
family, his job, life in the Seam. She makes him go back to
the night of the firebombing and reenact it, starting at his
house, working his way down across the Meadow and
through the woods to the lake. I straggle behind the film
crew and the bodyguards, feeling their presence to be a
violation of my beloved woods. This is a private place, a
sanctuary, already corrupted by the Capitol's evil. Even
after we've left behind the charred stumps near the fence,
we're still tripping over decomposing bodies. Do we have
to record it for everyone to see?
By the time we reach the lake, Gale seems to have lost
his ability to speak. Everyone's dripping in sweat--
especially Castor and Pollux in their insect shells--and
Cressida calls for a break. I scoop up handfuls of water
from the lake, wishing I could dive in and surface alone and
naked and unobserved. I wander around the perimeter for a
while. When I come back around to the little concrete house
beside the lake, I pause in the doorway and see Gale
propping the crooked poker he salvaged against the wall
by the hearth. For a moment I have an image of a lone
stranger, sometime far in the future, wandering lost in the
wilderness and coming upon this small place of refuge, with
the pile of split logs, the hearth, the poker. Wondering how
it came to be. Gale turns and meets my eyes and I know
he's thinking about our last meeting here. When we fought
over whether or not to run away. If we had, would District 12
still be there? I think it would. But the Capitol would still be
in control of Panem as well.
Cheese sandwiches are passed around and we eat
them in the shade of the trees. I intentionally sit at the far
edge of the group, next to Pollux, so I don't have to talk. No
one's talking much, really. In the relative quiet, the birds
take back the woods. I nudge Pollux with my elbow and
point out a small black bird with a crown. It hops to a new
branch, momentarily opening its wings, showing off its
white patches. Pollux gestures to my pin and raises his
eyebrows questioningly. I nod, confirming it's a mockingjay.
I hold up one finger to say Wait, I'll show you, and whistle a
birdcall. The mockingjay cocks its head and whistles the
call right back at me. Then, to my surprise, Pollux whistles a
few notes of his own. The bird answers him immediately.
Pollux's face breaks into an expression of delight and he
has a series of melodic exchanges with the mockingjay. My
guess is it's the first conversation he's had in years. Music
draws mockingjays like blossoms do bees, and in a short
while he's got half a dozen of them perched in the branches
over our heads. He taps me on the arm and uses a twig to
write a word in the dirt. SING?
Usually, I'd decline, but it's kind of impossible to say no
to Pollux, given the circumstances. Besides, the
mockingjays' song voices are different from their whistles,
and I'd like him to hear them. So, before I actually think
about what I'm doing, I sing Rue's four notes, the ones she
used to signal the end of the workday in 11. The notes that
ended up as the background music to her murder. The
birds don't know that. They pick up the simple phrase and
bounce it back and forth between them in sweet harmony.
Just as they did in the Hunger Games before the muttations
broke through the trees, chased us onto the Cornucopia,
and slowly gnawed Cato to a bloody pulp--
"Want to hear them do a real song?" I burst out.
Anything to stop those memories. I'm on my feet, moving
back into the trees, resting my hand on the rough trunk of a
maple where the birds perch. I have not sung "The Hanging
Tree" out loud for ten years, because it's forbidden, but I
remember every word. I begin softly, sweetly, as my father
did.
"Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say
murdered three.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree."
The mockingjays begin to alter their songs as they
become aware of my new offering.
"Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where the dead man called out for his love
to flee.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree."
I have the birds' attention now. In one more verse,
surely they will have captured the melody, as it's simple and
repeats four times with little variation.
"Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run, so we'd both be free.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree."
A hush in the trees. Just the rustle of leaves in the
breeze. But no birds, mockingjay or other. Peeta's right.
They do fall silent when I sing. Just as they did for my father.
"Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with
me.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree."
The birds are waiting for me to continue. But that's it.
Last verse. In the stillness I remember the scene. I was
home from a day in the woods with my father. Sitting on the
floor with Prim, who was just a toddler, singing "The
Hanging Tree." Making us necklaces out of scraps of old
rope like it said in the song, not knowing the real meaning
of the words. The tune was simple and easy to harmonize
to, though, and back then I could memorize almost anything
set to music after a round or two. Suddenly, my mother
snatched the rope necklaces away and was yelling at my
father. I started to cry because my mother never yelled, and
then Prim was wailing and I ran outside to hide. As I had
exactly one hiding spot--in the Meadow under a
honeysuckle bush--my father found me immediately. He
calmed me down and told me everything was fine, only
we'd better not sing that song anymore. My mother just
wanted me to forget it. So, of course, every word was
immediately, irrevocably branded into my brain.
We didn't sing it anymore, my father and I, or even
speak of it. After he died, it used to come back to me a lot.
Being older, I began to understand the lyrics. At the
beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend
to secretly meet up with him at midnight. But it's an odd
place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for
murder. The murderer's lover must have had something to
do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punish
her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee.
That's weird obviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it's not
until the third verse that "The Hanging Tree" begins to get
unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead
murderer. He's still in the hanging tree. And even though he
told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she's coming to
meet him. The phrase Where I told you to run, so we'd both
be free is the most troubling because at first you think he's
talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety.
But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To
death. In the final stanza, it's clear that that's what he's
waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead
next to him in the tree.
I used to think the murderer was the creepiest guy
imaginable. Now, with a couple of trips to the Hunger
Games under my belt, I decide not to judge him without
knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already
sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier. To
let her know he'd be waiting. Or maybe he thought the place
he was leaving her was really worse than death. Didn't I
want to kill Peeta with that syringe to save him from the
Capitol? Was that really my only option? Probably not, but I
couldn't think of another at the time.
I guess my mother thought the whole thing was too
twisted for a seven-year-old, though. Especially one who
made her own rope necklaces. It wasn't like hanging was
something that only happened in a story. Plenty of people
were executed that way in 12. You can bet she didn't want
me singing it in front of my music class. She probably
wouldn't like me doing it here for Pollux even, but at least
I'm not--wait, no, I'm wrong. As I glance sideways, I see
Castor has been taping me. Everyone is watching me
intently. And Pollux has tears running down his cheeks
because no doubt my freaky song has dredged up some
terrible incident in his life. Great. I sigh and lean back
against the trunk. That's when the mockingjays begin their
rendition of "The Hanging Tree." In their mouths, it's quite
beautiful. Conscious of being filmed, I stand quietly until I
hear Cressida call, "Cut!"
Plutarch crosses to me, laughing. "Where do you
come up with this stuff? No one would believe it if we made
it up!" He throws an arm around me and kisses me on the
top of my head with a loud smack. "You're golden!"
"I wasn't doing it for the cameras," I say.
"Lucky they were on, then," he says. "Come on,
everybody, back to town!"
As we trudge back through the woods, we reach a
boulder, and both Gale and I turn our heads in the same
direction, like a pair of dogs catching a scent on the wind.
Cressida notices and asks what lies that way. We admit,
without acknowledging each other, it's our old hunting
rendezvous place. She wants to see it, even after we tell
her it's nothing really.
Nothing but a place where I was happy, I think.
Our rock ledge overlooking the valley. Perhaps a little
less green than usual, but the blackberry bushes hang
heavy with fruit. Here began countless days of hunting and
snaring, fishing and gathering, roaming together through
the woods, unloading our thoughts while we filled our game
bags. This was the doorway to both sustenance and sanity.
And we were each other's key.
There's no District 12 to escape from now, no
Peacekeepers to trick, no hungry mouths to feed. The
Capitol took away all of that, and I'm on the verge of losing
Gale as well. The glue of mutual need that bonded us so
tightly together for all those years is melting away. Dark
patches, not light, show in the spaces between us. How can
it be that today, in the face of 12's horrible demise, we are
too angry to even speak to each other?
Gale as good as lied to me. That was unacceptable,
even if he was concerned about my well-being. His apology
seemed genuine, though. And I threw it back in his face
with an insult to make sure it stung. What is happening to
us? Why are we always at odds now? It's all a muddle, but I
somehow feel that if I went back to the root of our troubles,
my actions would be at the heart of it. Do I really want to
drive him away?
My fingers encircle a blackberry and pluck it from its
stem. I roll it gently between my thumb and forefinger.
Suddenly, I turn to him and toss it in his direction. "And may
the odds--" I say. I throw it high so he has plenty of time to
decide whether to knock it aside or accept it.
Gale's eyes train on me, not the berry, but at the last
moment, he opens his mouth and catches it. He chews,
swallows, and there's a long pause before he says "--be
ever in your favor." But he does say it.
Cressida has us sit in the nook in the rocks, where it's
impossible not to be touching, and coaxes us into talking
about hunting. What drove us out into the woods, how we
met, favorite moments. We thaw, begin to laugh a little, as
we relate mishaps with bees and wild dogs and skunks.
When the conversation turns to how it felt to translate our
skill with weapons to the bombing in 8, I stop talking. Gale
just says, "Long overdue."
By the time we reach the town square, afternoon's
sinking into evening. I take Cressida to the rubble of the
bakery and ask her to film something. The only emotion I
can muster is exhaustion. "Peeta, this is your home. None
of your family has been heard of since the bombing. Twelve
is gone. And you're calling for a cease-fire?" I look across
the emptiness. "There's no one left to hear you."
As we stand before the lump of metal that was the
gallows, Cressida asks if either of us has ever been
tortured. In answer, Gale pulls off his shirt and turns his
back to the camera. I stare at the lash marks, and again
hear the whistling of the whip, see his bloody figure hanging
unconscious by his wrists.
"I'm done," I announce. "I'll meet you at the Victor's
Village. Something for...my mother."
I guess I walked here, but the next thing I'm conscious
of is sitting on the floor in front of the kitchen cabinets of our
house in the Victor's Village. Meticulously lining ceramic
jars and glass bottles into a box. Placing clean cotton
bandages between them to prevent breaking. Wrapping
bunches of dried flowers.
Suddenly, I remember the rose on my dresser. Was it
real? If so, is it still up there? I have to resist the temptation
to check. If it's there, it will only frighten me all over again. I
hurry with my packing.
When the cabinets are empty, I rise to find that Gale
has materialized in my kitchen. It's disturbing how
soundlessly he can appear. He's leaning on the table, his
fingers spread wide against the wood grain. I set the box
between us. "Remember?" he asks. "This is where you
kissed me."
So the heavy dose of morphling administered after the
whipping wasn't enough to erase that from his
consciousness. "I didn't think you'd remember that," I say.
"Have to be dead to forget. Maybe even not then," he
tells me. "Maybe I'll be like that man in 'The Hanging Tree.'
Still waiting for an answer." Gale, who I have never seen
cry, has tears in his eyes. To keep them from spilling over, I
reach forward and press my lips against his. We taste of
heat, ashes, and misery. It's a surprising flavor for such a
gentle kiss. He pulls away first and gives me a wry smile. "I
knew you'd kiss me."
"How?" I say. Because I didn't know myself.
"Because I'm in pain," he says. "That's the only way I
get your attention." He picks up the box. "Don't worry,
Katniss. It'll pass." He leaves before I can answer.
I'm too weary to work through his latest charge. I spend
the short ride back to 13 curled up in a seat, trying to ignore
Plutarch going on about one of his favorite subjects--
weapons mankind no longer has at its disposal. High-flying
planes, military satellites, cell disintegrators, drones,
biological weapons with expiration dates. Brought down by
the destruction of the atmosphere or lack of resources or
moral squeamishness. You can hear the regret of a Head
Gamemaker who can only dream of such toys, who must
make do with hovercraft and land-to-land missiles and plain
old guns.
After dropping off my Mockingjay suit, I go straight to
bed without eating. Even so, Prim has to shake me to get
me up in the morning. After breakfast, I ignore my schedule
and take a nap in the supply closet. When I come to,
crawling out from between the boxes of chalk and pencils,
it's dinnertime again. I get an extra-large portion of pea
soup and am headed back to Compartment E when Boggs
intercepts me.
"There's a meeting in Command. Disregard your
current schedule," he says.
"Done," I say.
"Did you follow it at all today?" he asks in
exasperation.
"Who knows? I'm mentally disoriented." I hold up my
wrist to show my medical bracelet and realize it's gone.
"See? I can't even remember they took my bracelet. Why
do they want me in Command? Did I miss something?"
"I think Cressida wanted to show you the Twelve
propos. But I guess you'll see them when they air," he says.
"That's what I need a schedule of. When the propos
air," I say. He shoots me a look but doesn't comment
further.
People have crowded into Command, but they've
saved me a seat between Finnick and Plutarch. The
screens are already up on the table, showing the regular
Capitol feed.
"What's going on? Aren't we seeing the Twelve
propos?" I ask.
"Oh, no," says Plutarch. "I mean, possibly. I don't know
exactly what footage Beetee plans to use."
"Beetee thinks he's found a way to break into the feed
nationwide," says Finnick. "So that our propos will air in the
Capitol, too. He's down working on it in Special Defense
now. There's live programming tonight. Snow's making an
appearance or something. I think it's starting."
The Capitol seal appears, underscored by the anthem.
Then I'm staring directly into President Snow's snake eyes
as he greets the nation. He seems barricaded behind his
podium, but the white rose in his lapel is in full view. The
camera pulls back to include Peeta, off to one side in front
of a projected map of Panem. He's sitting in an elevated
chair, his shoes supported by a metal rung. The foot of his
prosthetic leg taps out a strange irregular beat. Beads of
sweat have broken through the layer of powder on his
upper lip and forehead. But it's the look in his eyes--angry
yet unfocused--that frightens me the most.
"He's worse," I whisper. Finnick grasps my hand, to
give me an anchor, and I try to hang on.
Peeta begins to speak in a frustrated tone about the
need for the cease-fire. He highlights the damage done to
key infrastructure in various districts, and as he speaks,
parts of the map light up, showing images of the
destruction. A broken dam in 7. A derailed train with a pool
of toxic waste spilling from the tank cars. A granary
collapsing after a fire. All of these he attributes to rebel
action.
Bam! Without warning, I'm suddenly on television,
standing in the rubble of the bakery.
Plutarch jumps to his feet. "He did it! Beetee broke in!"
The room's buzzing with reaction when Peeta's back,
distracted. He has seen me on the monitor. He tries to pick
up his speech by moving on to the bombing of a water
purification plant, when a clip of Finnick talking about Rue
replaces him. And then the whole thing breaks down into a
broadcast battle, as the Capitol tech masters try to fend off
Beetee's attack. But they are unprepared, and Beetee,
apparently anticipating he would not hold on to control, has
an arsenal of five- to ten-second clips to work with. We
watch the official presentation deteriorate as it's peppered
with choice shots from the propos.
Plutarch's in spasms of delight and most everybody is
cheering Beetee on, but Finnick remains still and
speechless beside me. I meet Haymitch's eyes from
across the room and see my own dread mirrored back. The
recognition that with every cheer, Peeta slips even farther
from our grasp.
The Capitol seal's back up, accompanied by a flat
audio tone. This lasts about twenty seconds before Snow
and Peeta return. The set is in turmoil. We're hearing frantic
exchanges from their booth. Snow plows forward, saying
that clearly the rebels are now attempting to disrupt the
dissemination of information they find incriminating, but
both truth and justice will reign. The full broadcast will
resume when security has been reinstated. He asks Peeta
if, given tonight's demonstration, he has any parting
thoughts for Katniss Everdeen.
At the mention of my name, Peeta's face contorts in
effort. "Katniss...how do you think this will end? What will be
left? No one is safe. Not in the Capitol. Not in the districts.
And you...in Thirteen..." He inhales sharply, as if fighting for
air; his eyes look insane. "Dead by morning!"
Off camera, Snow orders, "End it!" Beetee throws the
whole thing into chaos by flashing a still shot of me standing
in front of the hospital at three-second intervals. But
between the images, we are privy to the real-life action
being played out on the set. Peeta's attempt to continue
speaking. The camera knocked down to record the white
tiled floor. The scuffle of boots. The impact of the blow that's
inseparable from Peeta's cry of pain.
And his blood as it splatters the tiles.
PART II
"THE ASSAULT"
10
The scream begins in my lower back and works its
way up through my body only to jam in my throat. I am Avox
mute, choking on my grief. Even if I could release the
muscles in my neck, let the sound tear into space, would
anyone notice it? The room's in an uproar. Questions and
demands ring out as they try to decipher Peeta's words.
"And you...in Thirteen...dead by morning!" Yet no one is
asking about the messenger whose blood has been
replaced by static.
A voice calls the others to attention. "Shut up!" Every
pair of eyes falls on Haymitch. "It's not some big mystery!
The boy's telling us we're about to be attacked. Here. In
Thirteen."
"How would he have that information?"
"Why should we trust him?"
"How do you know?"
Haymitch gives a growl of frustration. "They're beating
him bloody while we speak. What more do you need?
Katniss, help me out here!"
I have to give myself a shake to free my words.
"Haymitch's right. I don't know where Peeta got the
information. Or if it's true. But he believes it is. And they're--
" I can't say aloud what Snow's doing to him.
"You don't know him," Haymitch says to Coin. "We do.
Get your people ready."
The president doesn't seem alarmed, only somewhat
perplexed, by this turn in events. She mulls over the words,
tapping one finger lightly on the rim of the control board in
front of her. When she speaks, she addresses Haymitch in
an even voice. "Of course, we have prepared for such a
scenario. Although we have decades of support for the
assumption that further direct attacks on Thirteen would be
counterproductive to the Capitol's cause. Nuclear missiles
would release radiation into the atmosphere, with
incalculable environmental results. Even routine bombing
could badly damage our military compound, which we know
they hope to regain. And, of course, they invite a
counterstrike. It is conceivable that, given our current
alliance with the rebels, those would be viewed as
acceptable risks."
"You think so?" says Haymitch. It's a shade too
sincere, but the subtleties of irony are often wasted in 13.
"I do. At any rate, we're overdue for a Level Five
security drill," says Coin. "Let's proceed with the lockdown."
She begins to type rapidly on her keyboard, authorizing her
decision. The moment she raises her head, it begins.
There have been two low-level drills since I arrived in
13. I don't remember much about the first. I was in intensive
care in the hospital and I think the patients were exempted,
as the complications of removing us for a practice drill
outweighed the benefits. I was vaguely aware of a
mechanical voice instructing people to congregate in yellow
zones. During the second, a Level Two drill meant for minor
crises--such as a temporary quarantine while citizens were
tested for contagion during a flu outbreak--we were
supposed to return to our living quarters. I stayed behind a
pipe in the laundry room, ignored the pulsating beeps
coming over the audio system, and watched a spider
construct a web. Neither experience has prepared me for
the wordless, eardrum-piercing, fear-inducing sirens that
now permeate 13. There would be no disregarding this
sound, which seems designed to throw the whole
population into a frenzy. But this is 13 and that doesn't
happen.
Boggs guides Finnick and me out of Command, along
the hall to a doorway, and onto a wide stairway. Streams of
people are converging to form a river that flows only
downward. No one shrieks or tries to push ahead. Even the
children don't resist. We descend, flight after flight,
speechless, because no word could be heard above this
sound. I look for my mother and Prim, but it's impossible to
see anyone but those immediately around me. They're both
working in the hospital tonight, though, so there's no way
they can miss the drill.
My ears pop and my eyes feel heavy. We are coalmine
deep. The only plus is that the farther we retreat into
the earth, the less shrill the sirens become. It's as if they
were meant to physically drive us away from the surface,
which I suppose they are. Groups of people begin to peel
off into marked doorways and still Boggs directs me
downward, until finally the stairs end at the edge of an
enormous cavern. I start to walk straight in and Boggs
stops me, shows me that I must wave my schedule in front
of a scanner so that I'm accounted for. No doubt the
information's going to some computer somewhere to make
sure no one's gone astray.
The place seems unable to decide if it's natural or
man-made. Certain areas of the walls are stone, while steel
beams and concrete heavily reinforce others. Sleeping
bunks are hewn right into the rock walls. There's a kitchen,
bathrooms, a first-aid station. This place was designed for
an extended stay.
White signs with letters or numbers are placed at
intervals around the cavern. As Boggs tells Finnick and me
to report to the area that matches our assigned quarters--in
my case E for Compartment E--Plutarch strolls up. "Ah,
here you are," he says. Recent events have had little effect
on Plutarch's mood. He still has a happy glow from
Beetee's success on the Airtime Assault. Eyes on the
forest, not on the trees. Not on Peeta's punishment or 13's
imminent blasting. "Katniss, obviously this is a bad moment
for you, what with Peeta's setback, but you need to be
aware that others will be watching you."
"What?" I say. I can't believe he actually just
downgraded Peeta's dire circumstances to a setback.
"The other people in the bunker, they'll be taking their
cue on how to react from you. If you're calm and brave,
others will try to be as well. If you panic, it could spread like
wildfire," explains Plutarch. I just stare at him. "Fire is
catching, so to speak," he continues, as if I'm being slow on
the uptake.
"Why don't I just pretend I'm on camera, Plutarch?" I
say.
"Yes! Perfect. One is always much braver with an
audience," he says. "Look at the courage Peeta just
displayed!"
It's all I can do not to slap him.
"I've got to get back to Coin before lockdown. You
keep up the good work!" he says, and then heads off.
I cross to the big letter E posted on the wall. Our space
consists of a twelve-by-twelve-foot square of stone floor
delineated by painted lines. Carved into the wall are two
bunks--one of us will be sleeping on the floor--and a
ground-level cube space for storage. A piece of white
paper, coated in clear plastic, reads BUNKER PROTOCOL. I
stare fixedly at the little black specks on the sheet. For a
while, they're obscured by the residual blood droplets that I
can't seem to wipe from my vision. Slowly, the words come
into focus. The first section is entitled "On Arrival."
1. Make sure all members of your Compartment are
accounted for.
My mother and Prim haven't arrived, but I was one of
the first people to reach the bunker. Both of them are
probably helping to relocate hospital patients.
2. Go to the Supply Station and secure one pack for
each member of your Compartment. Ready your
Living Area. Return pack(s).
I scan the cavern until I locate the Supply Station, a
deep room set off by a counter. People wait behind it, but
there's not a lot of activity there yet. I walk over, give our
compartment letter, and request three packs. A man
checks a sheet, pulls the specified packs from shelving,
and swings them up onto the counter. After sliding one on
my back and getting a grip on the other two with my hands, I
turn to find a group rapidly forming behind me. "Excuse
me," I say as I carry my supplies through the others. Is it a
matter of timing? Or is Plutarch right? Are these people
modeling their behavior on mine?
Back at our space, I open one of the packs to find a
thin mattress, bedding, two sets of gray clothing, a
toothbrush, a comb, and a flashlight. On examining the
contents of the other packs, I find the only discernible
difference is that they contain both gray and white outfits.
The latter will be for my mother and Prim, in case they have
medical duties. After I make up the beds, store the clothes,
and return the backpacks, I've got nothing to do but observe
the last rule.
3. Await further instructions.
I sit cross-legged on the floor to await. A steady flow of
people begins to fill the room, claiming spaces, collecting
supplies. It won't take long until the place is full up. I wonder
if my mother and Prim are going to stay the night at
wherever the hospital patients have been taken. But, no, I
don't think so. They were on the list here. I'm starting to get
anxious, when my mother appears. I look behind her into a
sea of strangers. "Where's Prim?" I ask.
"Isn't she here?" she replies. "She was supposed to
come straight down from the hospital. She left ten minutes
before I did. Where is she? Where could she have gone?"
I squeeze my lids shut tight for a moment, to track her
as I would prey on a hunt. See her react to the sirens, rush
to help the patients, nod as they gesture for her to descend
to the bunker, and then hesitate with her on the stairs. Torn
for a moment. But why?
My eyes fly open. "The cat! She went back for him!"
"Oh, no," my mother says. We both know I'm right.
We're pushing against the incoming tide, trying to get out of
the bunker. Up ahead, I can see them preparing to shut the
thick metal doors. Slowly rotating the metal wheels on
either side inward. Somehow I know that once they have
been sealed, nothing in the world will convince the soldiers
to open them. Perhaps it will even be beyond their control.
I'm indiscriminately shoving people aside as I shout for
them to wait. The space between the doors shrinks to a
yard, a foot; there are only a few inches left when I jam my
hand through the crack.
"Open it! Let me out!" I cry.
Consternation shows on the soldiers' faces as they
reverse the wheels a bit. Not enough to let me pass, but
enough to avoid crushing my fingers. I take the opportunity
to wedge my shoulder into the opening. "Prim!" I holler up
the stairs. My mother pleads with the guards as I try to
wriggle my way out. "Prim!"
Then I hear it. The faint sound of footsteps on the
stairs. "We're coming!" I hear my sister call.
"Hold the door!" That was Gale.
"They're coming!" I tell the guards, and they slide the
doors open about a foot. But I don't dare move--afraid
they'll lock us all out--until Prim appears, her cheeks flushed
with running, hauling Buttercup. I pull her inside and Gale
follows, twisting an armload of baggage sideways to get it
into the bunker. The doors are closed with a loud and final
clank.
"What were you thinking?" I give Prim an angry shake
and then hug her, squashing Buttercup between us.
Prim's explanation is already on her lips. "I couldn't
leave him behind, Katniss. Not twice. You should have seen
him pacing the room and howling. He'd come back to
protect us."
"Okay. Okay." I take a few breaths to calm myself, step
back, and lift Buttercup by the scruff of the neck. "I should've
drowned you when I had the chance." His ears flatten and
he raises a paw. I hiss before he gets a chance, which
seems to annoy him a little, since he considers hissing his
own personal sound of contempt. In retaliation, he gives a
helpless kitten mew that brings my sister immediately to his
defense.
"Oh, Katniss, don't tease him," she says, folding him
back in her arms. "He's already so upset."
The idea that I've wounded the brute's tiny cat feelings
just invites further taunting. But Prim's genuinely distressed
for him. So instead, I visualize Buttercup's fur lining a pair of
gloves, an image that has helped me deal with him over the
years. "Okay, sorry. We're under the big E on the wall.
Better get him settled in before he loses it." Prim hurries
off, and I find myself face-to-face with Gale. He's holding the
box of medical supplies from our kitchen in 12. Site of our
last conversation, kiss, fallout, whatever. My game bag's
slung across his shoulder.
"If Peeta's right, these didn't stand a chance," he says.
Peeta. Blood like raindrops on the window. Like wet
mud on boots.
"Thanks for...everything." I take our stuff. "What were
you doing up in our rooms?"
"Just double-checking," he says. "We're in Forty-
Seven if you need me."
Practically everyone withdrew to their spaces when the
doors shut, so I get to cross to our new home with at least
five hundred people watching me. I try to appear extra calm
to make up for my frantic crashing through the crowd. Like
that's fooling anyone. So much for setting an example. Oh,
who cares? They all think I'm nuts anyway. One man, who I
think I knocked to the floor, catches my eye and rubs his
elbow resentfully. I almost hiss at him, too.
Prim has Buttercup installed on the lower bunk, draped
in a blanket so that only his face pokes out. This is how he
likes to be when there's thunder, the one thing that actually
frightens him. My mother puts her box carefully in the cube. I
crouch, my back supported by the wall, to check what Gale
managed to rescue in my hunting bag. The plant book, the
hunting jacket, my parents' wedding photo, and the
personal contents of my drawer. My mockingjay pin now
lives with Cinna's outfit, but there's the gold locket and the
silver parachute with the spile and Peeta's pearl. I knot the
pearl into the corner of the parachute, bury it deep in the
recesses of the bag, as if it's Peeta's life and no one can
take it away as long as I guard it.
The faint sound of the sirens cuts off sharply. Coin's
voice comes over the district audio system, thanking us all
for an exemplary evacuation of the upper levels. She
stresses that this is not a drill, as Peeta Mellark, the District
12 victor, has possibly made a televised reference to an
attack on 13 tonight.
That's when the first bomb hits. There's an initial sense
of impact followed by an explosion that resonates in my
innermost parts, the lining of my intestines, the marrow of
my bones, the roots of my teeth. We're all going to die, I
think. My eyes turn upward, expecting to see giant cracks
race across the ceiling, massive chunks of stone raining
down on us, but the bunker itself gives only a slight shudder.
The lights go out and I experience the disorientation of total
darkness. Speechless human sounds--spontaneous
shrieks, ragged breaths, baby whimpers, one musical bit of
insane laughter--dance around in the charged air. Then
there's a hum of a generator, and a dim wavering glow
replaces the stark lighting that is the norm in 13. It's closer
to what we had in our homes in 12, when the candles and
fire burned low on a winter's night.
I reach for Prim in the twilight, clamp my hand on her
leg, and pull myself over to her. Her voice remains steady
as she croons to Buttercup. "It's all right, baby, it's all right.
We'll be okay down here."
My mother wraps her arms around us. I allow myself to
feel young for a moment and rest my head on her shoulder.
"That was nothing like the bombs in Eight," I say.
"Probably a bunker missile," says Prim, keeping her
voice soothing for the cat's sake. "We learned about them
during the orientation for new citizens. They're designed to
penetrate deep in the ground before they go off. Because
there's no point in bombing Thirteen on the surface
anymore."
"Nuclear?" I ask, feeling a chill run through me.
"Not necessarily," says Prim. "Some just have a lot of
explosives in them. But...it could be either kind, I guess."
The gloom makes it hard to see the heavy metal doors
at the end of the bunker. Would they be any protection
against a nuclear attack? And even if they were one
hundred percent effective at sealing out the radiation, which
is really unlikely, would we ever be able to leave this place?
The thought of spending whatever remains of my life in this
stone vault horrifies me. I want to run madly for the door and
demand to be released into whatever lies above. It's
pointless. They would never let me out, and I might start
some kind of stampede.
"We're so far down, I'm sure we're safe," says my
mother wanly. Is she thinking of my father's being blown to
nothingness in the mines? "It was a close call, though.
Thank goodness Peeta had the wherewithal to warn us."
The wherewithal. A general term that somehow
includes everything that was needed for him to sound the
alarm. The knowledge, the opportunity, the courage. And
something else I can't define. Peeta seemed to have been
waging a sort of battle in his mind, fighting to get the
message out. Why? The ease with which he manipulates
words is his greatest talent. Was his difficulty a result of his
torture? Something more? Like madness?
Coin's voice, perhaps a shade grimmer, fills the
bunker, the volume level flickering with the lights.
"Apparently, Peeta Mellark's information was sound and we
owe him a great debt of gratitude. Sensors indicate the first
missile was not nuclear, but very powerful. We expect more
will follow. For the duration of the attack, citizens are to stay
in their assigned areas unless otherwise notified."
A soldier alerts my mother that she's needed in the
first-aid station. She's reluctant to leave us, even though
she'll only be thirty yards away.
"We'll be fine, really," I tell her. "Do you think anything
could get past him?" I point to Buttercup, who gives me
such a halfhearted hiss, we all have to laugh a little. Even I
feel sorry for him. After my mother goes, I suggest, "Why
don't you climb in with him, Prim?"
"I know it's silly...but I'm afraid the bunk might collapse
on us during the attack," she says.
If the bunks collapse, the whole bunker will have given
way and buried us, but I decide this kind of logic won't
actually be helpful. Instead, I clean out the storage cube and
make Buttercup a bed inside. Then I pull a mattress in front
of it for my sister and me to share.
We're given clearance in small groups to use the
bathroom and brush our teeth, although showering has
been canceled for the day. I curl up with Prim on the
mattress, double layering the blankets because the cavern
emits a dank chill. Buttercup, miserable even with Prim's
constant attention, huddles in the cube and exhales cat
breath in my face.
Despite the disagreeable conditions, I'm glad to have
time with my sister. My extreme preoccupation since I
came here--no, since the first Games, really--has left little
attention for her. I haven't been watching over her the way I
should, the way I used to. After all, it was Gale who checked
our compartment, not me. Something to make up for.
I realize I've never even bothered to ask her about how
she's handling the shock of coming here. "So, how are you
liking Thirteen, Prim?" I offer.
"Right now?" she asks. We both laugh. "I miss home
badly sometimes. But then I remember there's nothing left
to miss anymore. I feel safer here. We don't have to worry
about you. Well, not the same way." She pauses, and then
a shy smile crosses her lips. "I think they're going to train
me to be a doctor."
It's the first I've heard of it. "Well, of course, they are.
They'd be stupid not to."
"They've been watching me when I help out in the
hospital. I'm already taking the medic courses. It's just
beginner's stuff. I know a lot of it from home. Still, there's
plenty to learn," she tells me.
"That's great," I say. Prim a doctor. She couldn't even
dream of it in 12. Something small and quiet, like a match
being struck, lights up the gloom inside me. This is the sort
of future a rebellion could bring.
"What about you, Katniss? How are you managing?"
Her fingertip moves in short, gentle strokes between
Buttercup's eyes. "And don't say you're fine."
It's true. Whatever the opposite of fine is, that's what I
am. So I go ahead and tell her about Peeta, his
deterioration on-screen, and how I think they must be killing
him at this very moment. Buttercup has to rely on himself for
a while, because now Prim turns her attention to me. Pulling
me closer, brushing the hair back behind my ears with her
fingers. I've stopped talking because there's really nothing
left to say and there's this piercing sort of pain where my
heart is. Maybe I'm even having a heart attack, but it doesn't
seem worth mentioning.
"Katniss, I don't think President Snow will kill Peeta,"
she says. Of course, she says this; it's what she thinks will
calm me. But her next words come as a surprise. "If he
does, he won't have anyone left you want. He won't have
any way to hurt you."
Suddenly, I am reminded of another girl, one who had
seen all the evil the Capitol had to offer. Johanna Mason,
the tribute from District 7, in the last arena. I was trying to
prevent her from going into the jungle where the jabberjays
mimicked the voices of loved ones being tortured, but she
brushed me off, saying, "They can't hurt me. I'm not like
the rest of you. There's no one left I love."
Then I know Prim is right, that Snow cannot afford to
waste Peeta's life, especially now, while the Mockingjay
causes so much havoc. He's killed Cinna already.
Destroyed my home. My family, Gale, and even Haymitch
are out of his reach. Peeta's all he has left.
"So, what do you think they'll do to him?" I ask.
Prim sounds about a thousand years old when she
speaks.
"Whatever it takes to break you."
11
What will break me?
This is the question that consumes me over the next
three days as we wait to be released from our prison of
safety. What will break me into a million pieces so that I am
beyond repair, beyond usefulness? I mention it to no one,
but it devours my waking hours and weaves itself
throughout my nightmares.
Four more bunker missiles fall over this period, all
massive, all very damaging, but there's no urgency to the
attack. The bombs are spread out over the long hours so
that just when you think the raid is over, another blast sends
shock waves through your guts. It feels more designed to
keep us in lockdown than to decimate 13. Cripple the
district, yes. Give the people plenty to do to get the place
running again. But destroy it? No. Coin was right on that
point. You don't destroy what you want to acquire in the
future. I assume what they really want, in the short term, is to
stop the Airtime Assaults and keep me off the televisions of
Panem.
We receive next to no information about what is
happening. Our screens never come on, and we get only
brief audio updates from Coin about the nature of the
bombs. Certainly, the war is still being waged, but as to its
status, we're in the dark.
Inside the bunker, cooperation is the order of the day.
We adhere to a strict schedule for meals and bathing,
exercise and sleep. Small periods of socialization are
granted to alleviate the tedium. Our space becomes very
popular because both children and adults have a
fascination with Buttercup. He attains celebrity status with
his evening game of Crazy Cat. I created this by accident a
few years ago, during a winter blackout. You simply wiggle
a flashlight beam around on the floor, and Buttercup tries to
catch it. I'm petty enough to enjoy it because I think it makes
him look stupid. Inexplicably, everyone here thinks he's
clever and delightful. I'm even issued a special set of
batteries--an enormous waste--to be used for this purpose.
The citizens of 13 are truly starved for entertainment.
It's on the third night, during our game, that I answer the
question eating away at me. Crazy Cat becomes a
metaphor for my situation. I am Buttercup. Peeta, the thing I
want so badly to secure, is the light. As long as Buttercup
feels he has the chance of catching the elusive light under
his paws, he's bristling with aggression. (That's how I've
been since I left the arena, with Peeta alive.) When the light
goes out completely, Buttercup's temporarily distraught and
confused, but he recovers and moves on to other things.
(That's what would happen if Peeta died.) But the one thing
that sends Buttercup into a tailspin is when I leave the light
on but put it hopelessly out of his reach, high on the wall,
beyond even his jumping skills. He paces below the wall,
wails, and can't be comforted or distracted. He's useless
until I shut the light off. (That's what Snow is trying to do to
me now, only I don't know what form his game takes.)
Maybe this realization on my part is all Snow needs.
Thinking that Peeta was in his possession and being
tortured for rebel information was bad. But thinking that he's
being tortured specifically to incapacitate me is
unendurable. And it's under the weight of this revelation that
I truly begin to break.
After Crazy Cat, we're directed to bed. The power's
been coming and going; sometimes the lamps burn at full
brightness, other times we squint at one another in the
brownouts. At bedtime they turn the lamps to near darkness
and activate safety lights in each space. Prim, who's
decided the walls will hold up, snuggles with Buttercup on
the lower bunk. My mother's on the upper. I offer to take a
bunk, but they make me keep to the floor mattress since I
flail around so much when I'm sleeping.
I'm not flailing now, as my muscles are rigid with the
tension of holding myself together. The pain over my heart
returns, and from it I imagine tiny fissures spreading out into
my body. Through my torso, down my arms and legs, over
my face, leaving it crisscrossed with cracks. One good jolt
of a bunker missile and I could shatter into strange, razorsharp
shards.
When the restless, wiggling majority has settled into
sleep, I carefully extricate myself from my blanket and tiptoe
through the cavern until I find Finnick, feeling for some
unspecified reason that he will understand. He sits under
the safety light in his space, knotting his rope, not even
pretending to rest. As I whisper my discovery of Snow's
plan to break me, it dawns on me. This strategy is very old
news to Finnick. It's what broke him.
"This is what they're doing to you with Annie, isn't it?" I
ask.
"Well, they didn't arrest her because they thought she'd
be a wealth of rebel information," he says. "They know I'd
never have risked telling her anything like that. For her own
protection."
"Oh, Finnick. I'm so sorry," I say.
"No, I'm sorry. That I didn't warn you somehow," he tells
me.
Suddenly, a memory surfaces. I'm strapped to my bed,
mad with rage and grief after the rescue. Finnick is trying to
console me about Peeta. "They'll figure out he doesn't
know anything pretty fast. And they won't kill him if they
think they can use him against you."
"You did warn me, though. On the hovercraft. Only
when you said they'd use Peeta against me, I thought you
meant like bait. To lure me into the Capitol somehow," I
say.
"I shouldn't have said even that. It was too late for it to
be of any help to you. Since I hadn't warned you before the
Quarter Quell, I should've shut up about how Snow
operates." Finnick yanks on the end of his rope, and an
intricate knot becomes a straight line again. "It's just that I
didn't understand when I met you. After your first Games, I
thought the whole romance was an act on your part. We all
expected you'd continue that strategy. But it wasn't until
Peeta hit the force field and nearly died that I--" Finnick
hesitates.
I think back to the arena. How I sobbed when Finnick
revived Peeta. The quizzical look on Finnick's face. The
way he excused my behavior, blaming it on my pretend
pregnancy. "That you what?"
"That I knew I'd misjudged you. That you do love him.
I'm not saying in what way. Maybe you don't know yourself.
But anyone paying attention could see how much you care
about him," he says gently.
Anyone? On Snow's visit before the Victory Tour, he
challenged me to erase any doubts of my love for Peeta.
"Convince me," Snow said. It seems, under that hot pink
sky with Peeta's life in limbo, I finally did. And in doing so, I
gave him the weapon he needed to break me.
Finnick and I sit for a long time in silence, watching the
knots bloom and vanish, before I can ask, "How do you
bear it?"
Finnick looks at me in disbelief. "I don't, Katniss!
Obviously, I don't. I drag myself out of nightmares each
morning and find there's no relief in waking." Something in
my expression stops him. "Better not to give in to it. It takes
ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to
fall apart."
Well, he must know. I take a deep breath, forcing
myself back into one piece.
"The more you can distract yourself, the better," he
says. "First thing tomorrow, we'll get you your own rope.
Until then, take mine."
I spend the rest of the night on my mattress
obsessively making knots, holding them up for Buttercup's
inspection. If one looks suspicious, he swipes it out of the
air and bites it a few times to make sure it's dead. By
morning, my fingers are sore, but I'm still holding on.
With twenty-four hours of quiet behind us, Coin finally
announces we can leave the bunker. Our old quarters have
been destroyed by the bombings. Everyone must follow
exact directions to their new compartments. We clean our
spaces, as directed, and file obediently toward the door.
Before I'm halfway there, Boggs appears and pulls me
from the line. He signals for Gale and Finnick to join us.
People move aside to let us by. Some even smile at me
since the Crazy Cat game seems to have made me more
lovable. Out the door, up the stairs, down the hall to one of
those multidirectional elevators, and finally we arrive at
Special Defense. Nothing along our route has been
damaged, but we are still very deep.
Boggs ushers us into a room virtually identical to
Command. Coin, Plutarch, Haymitch, Cressida, and
everybody else around the table looks exhausted.
Someone has finally broken out the coffee--although I'm
sure it's viewed only as an emergency stimulant--and
Plutarch has both hands wrapped tightly around his cup as
if at any moment it might be taken away.
There's no small talk. "We need all four of you suited
up and aboveground," says the president. "You have two
hours to get footage showing the damage from the
bombing, establish that Thirteen's military unit remains not
only functional but dominant, and, most important, that the
Mockingjay is still alive. Any questions?"
"Can we have a coffee?" asks Finnick.
Steaming cups are handed out. I stare distastefully at
the shiny black liquid, never having been much of a fan of
the stuff, but thinking it might help me stay on my feet.
Finnick sloshes some cream in my cup and reaches into
the sugar bowl. "Want a sugar cube?" he asks in his old
seductive voice. That's how we met, with Finnick offering
me sugar. Surrounded by horses and chariots, costumed
and painted for the crowds, before we were allies. Before I
had any idea what made him tick. The memory actually
coaxes a smile out of me. "Here, it improves the taste," he
says in his real voice, plunking three cubes in my cup.
As I turn to go suit up as the Mockingjay, I catch Gale
watching me and Finnick unhappily. What now? Does he
actually think something's going on between us? Maybe he
saw me go to Finnick's last night. I would've passed the
Hawthornes' space to get there. I guess that probably
rubbed him the wrong way. Me seeking out Finnick's
company instead of his. Well, fine. I've got rope burn on my
fingers, I can barely hold my eyes open, and a camera
crew's waiting for me to do something brilliant. And Snow's
got Peeta. Gale can think whatever he wants.
In my new Remake Room in Special Defense, my prep
team slaps me into my Mockingjay suit, arranges my hair,
and applies minimal makeup before my coffee's even
cooled. In ten minutes, the cast and crew of the next propos
are making the circuitous trek to the outside. I slurp my
coffee as we travel, finding that the cream and sugar greatly
enhance its flavor. As I knock back the dregs that have
settled to the bottom of the cup, I feel a slight buzz start to
run through my veins.
After climbing a final ladder, Boggs hits a lever that
opens a trapdoor. Fresh air rushes in. I take big gulps and
for the first time allow myself to feel how much I hated the
bunker. We emerge into the woods, and my hands run
through the leaves overhead. Some are just starting to turn.
"What day is it?" I ask no one in particular. Boggs tells me
September begins next week.
September. That means Snow has had Peeta in his
clutches for five, maybe six weeks. I examine a leaf on my
palm and see I'm shaking. I can't will myself to stop. I blame
the coffee and try to focus on slowing my breathing, which
is far too rapid for my pace.
Debris begins to litter the forest floor. We come to our
first crater, thirty yards wide and I can't tell how deep. Very.
Boggs says anyone on the first ten levels would likely have
been killed. We skirt the pit and continue on.
"Can you rebuild it?" Gale asks.
"Not anytime soon. That one didn't get much. A few
backup generators and a poultry farm," says Boggs. "We'll
just seal it off."
The trees disappear as we enter the area inside the
fence. The craters are ringed with a mixture of old and new
rubble. Before the bombing, very little of the current 13 was
aboveground. A few guard stations. The training area.
About a foot of the top floor of our building--where
Buttercup's window jutted out--with several feet of steel on
top of it. Even that was never meant to withstand more than
a superficial attack.
"How much of an edge did the boy's warning give
you?" asks Haymitch.
"About ten minutes before our own systems would've
detected the missiles," says Boggs.
"But it did help, right?" I ask. I can't bear it if he says
no.
"Absolutely," Boggs replies. "Civilian evacuation was
completed. Seconds count when you're under attack. Ten
minutes meant lives saved."
Prim, I think. And Gale. They were in the bunker only a
couple of minutes before the first missile hit. Peeta might
have saved them. Add their names to the list of things I can
never stop owing him for.
Cressida has the idea to film me in front of the ruins of
the old Justice Building, which is something of a joke since
the Capitol's been using it as a backdrop for fake news
broadcasts for years, to show that the district no longer
existed. Now, with the recent attack, the Justice Building
sits about ten yards away from the edge of a new crater.
As we approach what used to be the grand entrance,
Gale points out something and the whole party slows down.
I don't know what the problem is at first and then I see the
ground strewn with fresh pink and red roses. "Don't touch
them!" I yell. "They're for me!"
The sickeningly sweet smell hits my nose, and my
heart begins to hammer against my chest. So I didn't
imagine it. The rose on my dresser. Before me lies Snow's
second delivery. Long-stemmed pink and red beauties, the
very flowers that decorated the set where Peeta and I
performed our post-victory interview. Flowers not meant for
one, but for a pair of lovers.
I explain to the others as best I can. Upon inspection,
they appear to be harmless, if genetically enhanced,
flowers. Two dozen roses. Slightly wilted. Most likely
dropped after the last bombing. A crew in special suits
collects them and carts them away. I feel certain they will
find nothing extraordinary in them, though. Snow knows
exactly what he's doing to me. It's like having Cinna beaten
to a pulp while I watch from my tribute tube. Designed to
unhinge me.
Like then, I try to rally and fight back. But as Cressida
gets Castor and Pollux in place, I feel my anxiety building.
I'm so tired, so wired, and so unable to keep my mind on
anything but Peeta since I've seen the roses. The coffee
was a huge mistake. What I didn't need was a stimulant. My
body visibly shakes and I can't seem to catch my breath.
After days in the bunker, I'm squinting no matter what
direction I turn, and the light hurts. Even in the cool breeze,
sweat trickles down my face.
"So, what exactly do you need from me again?" I ask.
"Just a few quick lines that show you're alive and still
fighting," says Cressida.
"Okay." I take my position and then I'm staring into the
red light. Staring. Staring. "I'm sorry, I've got nothing."
Cressida walks up to me. "You feeling okay?" I nod.
She pulls a small cloth from her pocket and blots my face.
"How about we do the old Q-and-A thing?"
"Yeah. That would help, I think." I cross my arms to hide
the shaking. Glance at Finnick, who gives me a thumbs-up.
But he's looking pretty shaky himself.
Cressida's back in position now. "So, Katniss. You've
survived the Capitol bombing of Thirteen. How did it
compare with what you experienced on the ground in
Eight?"
"We were so far underground this time, there was no
real danger. Thirteen's alive and well and so am--" My voice
cuts off in a dry, squeaking sound.
"Try the line again," says Cressida. "'Thirteen's alive
and well and so am I.'"
I take a breath, trying to force air down into my
diaphragm. "Thirteen's alive and so--" No, that's wrong.
I swear I can still smell those roses.
"Katniss, just this one line and you're done today. I
promise," says Cressida. "'Thirteen's alive and well and so
am I.'"
I swing my arms to loosen myself up. Place my fists on
my hips. Then drop them to my sides. Saliva's filling my
mouth at a ridiculous rate and I feel vomit at the back of my
throat. I swallow hard and open my lips so I can get the
stupid line out and go hide in the woods and--that's when I
start crying.
It's impossible to be the Mockingjay. Impossible to
complete even this one sentence. Because now I know that
everything I say will be directly taken out on Peeta. Result in
his torture. But not his death, no, nothing so merciful as that.
Snow will ensure that his life is much worse than death.
"Cut," I hear Cressida say quietly.
"What's wrong with her?" Plutarch says under his
breath.
"She's figured out how Snow's using Peeta," says
Finnick.
There's something like a collective sigh of regret from
the semicircle of people spread out before me. Because I
know this now. Because there will never be a way for me to
not know this again. Because, beyond the military
disadvantage losing a Mockingjay entails, I am broken.
Several sets of arms would embrace me. But in the
end, the only person I truly want to comfort me is Haymitch,
because he loves Peeta, too. I reach out for him and say
something like his name and he's there, holding me and
patting my back. "It's okay. It'll be okay, sweetheart." He sits
me on a length of broken marble pillar and keeps an arm
around me while I sob.
"I can't do this anymore," I say.
"I know," he says.
"All I can think of is--what he's going to do to Peeta--
because I'm the Mockingjay!" I get out.
"I know." Haymitch's arm tightens around me.
"Did you see? How weird he acted? What are they--
doing to him?" I'm gasping for air between sobs, but I
manage one last phrase. "It's my fault!" And then I cross
some line into hysteria and there's a needle in my arm and
the world slips away.
It must be strong, whatever they shot into me, because
it's a full day before I come to. My sleep wasn't peaceful,
though. I have the sense of emerging from a world of dark,
haunted places where I traveled alone. Haymitch sits in the
chair by my bed, his skin waxen, his eyes bloodshot. I
remember about Peeta and start to tremble again.
Haymitch reaches out and squeezes my shoulder. "It's
all right. We're going to try to get Peeta out."
"What?" That makes no sense.
"Plutarch's sending in a rescue team. He has people
on the inside. He thinks we can get Peeta back alive," he
says.
"Why didn't we before?" I say.
"Because it's costly. But everyone agrees this is the
thing to do. It's the same choice we made in the arena. To
do whatever it takes to keep you going. We can't lose the
Mockingjay now. And you can't perform unless you know
Snow can't take it out on Peeta." Haymitch offers me a cup.
"Here, drink something."
I slowly sit up and take a sip of water. "What do you
mean, costly?"
He shrugs. "Covers will be blown. People may die. But
keep in mind that they're dying every day. And it's not just
Peeta; we're getting Annie out for Finnick, too."
"Where is he?" I ask.
"Behind that screen, sleeping his sedative off. He lost
it right after we knocked you out," says Haymitch. I smile a
little, feel a bit less weak. "Yeah, it was a really excellent
shoot. You two cracked up and Boggs left to arrange the
mission to get Peeta. We're officially in reruns."
"Well, if Boggs is leading it, that's a plus," I say.
"Oh, he's on top of it. It was volunteer only, but he
pretended not to notice me waving my hand in the air," says
Haymitch. "See? He's already demonstrated good
judgment."
Something's wrong. Haymitch's trying a little too hard
to cheer me up. It's not really his style. "So who else
volunteered?"
"I think there were seven altogether," he says
evasively.
I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. "Who else,
Haymitch?" I insist.
Haymitch finally drops the good-natured act. "You
know who else, Katniss. You know who stepped up first."
Of course I do.
Gale.
12
Today I might lose both of them.
I try to imagine a world where both Gale's and Peeta's
voices have ceased. Hands stilled. Eyes unblinking. I'm
standing over their bodies, having a last look, leaving the
room where they lie. But when I open the door to step out
into the world, there's only a tremendous void. A pale gray
nothingness that is all my future holds.
"Do you want me to have them sedate you until it's
over?" asks Haymitch. He's not joking. This is a man who
spent his adult life at the bottom of a bottle, trying to
anesthetize himself against the Capitol's crimes. The
sixteen-year-old boy who won the second Quarter Quell
must have had people he loved--family, friends, a
sweetheart maybe--that he fought to get back to. Where are
they now? How is it that until Peeta and I were thrust upon
him, there was no one at all in his life? What did Snow do to
them?
"No," I say. "I want to go to the Capitol. I want to be part
of the rescue mission."
"They're gone," says Haymitch.
"How long ago did they leave? I could catch up. I could-
-" What? What could I do?
Haymitch shakes his head. "It'll never happen. You're
too valuable and too vulnerable. There was talk of sending
you to another district to divert the Capitol's attention while
the rescue takes place. But no one felt you could handle it."
"Please, Haymitch!" I'm begging now. "I have to do
something. I can't just sit here waiting to hear if they died.
There must be something I can do!"
"All right. Let me talk to Plutarch. You stay put." But I
can't. Haymitch's footsteps are still echoing in the outer hall
when I fumble my way through the slit in the dividing curtain
to find Finnick sprawled out on his stomach, his hands
twisted in his pillowcase. Although it's cowardly--cruel even-
-to rouse him from the shadowy, muted drug land to stark
reality, I go ahead and do it because I can't stand to face
this by myself.
As I explain our situation, his initial agitation
mysteriously ebbs. "Don't you see, Katniss, this will decide
things. One way or the other. By the end of the day, they'll
either be dead or with us. It's...it's more than we could hope
for!"
Well, that's a sunny view of our situation. And yet
there's something calming about the idea that this torment
could come to an end.
The curtain yanks back and there's Haymitch. He has a
job for us, if we can pull it together. They still need postbombing
footage of 13. "If we can get it in the next few
hours, Beetee can air it leading up to the rescue, and
maybe keep the Capitol's attention elsewhere."
"Yes, a distraction," says Finnick. "A decoy of sorts."
"What we really need is something so riveting that
even President Snow won't be able to tear himself away.
Got anything like that?" asks Haymitch.
Having a job that might help the mission snaps me into
focus. While I knock down breakfast and get prepped, I try
to think of what I might say. President Snow must be
wondering how that blood-splattered floor and his roses are
affecting me. If he wants me broken, then I will have to be
whole. But I don't think I will convince him of anything by
shouting a couple of defiant lines at the camera. Besides,
that won't buy the rescue team any time. Outbursts are
short. It's stories that take time.
I don't know if it will work, but when the television
crew's all assembled aboveground, I ask Cressida if she
could start out by asking me about Peeta. I take a seat on
the fallen marble pillar where I had my breakdown, wait for
the red light and Cressida's question.
"How did you meet Peeta?" she asks.
And then I do the thing that Haymitch has wanted since
my first interview. I open up. "When I met Peeta, I was
eleven years old, and I was almost dead." I talk about that
awful day when I tried to sell the baby clothes in the rain,
how Peeta's mother chased me from the bakery door, and
how he took a beating to bring me the loaves of bread that
saved our lives. "We had never even spoken. The first time
I ever talked to Peeta was on the train to the Games."
"But he was already in love with you," says Cressida.
"I guess so." I allow myself a small smile.
"How are you doing with the separation?" she asks.
"Not well. I know at any moment Snow could kill him.
Especially since he warned Thirteen about the bombing. It's
a terrible thing to live with," I say. "But because of what
they're putting him through, I don't have any reservations
anymore. About doing whatever it takes to destroy the
Capitol. I'm finally free." I turn my gaze skyward and watch
the flight of a hawk across the sky. "President Snow once
admitted to me that the Capitol was fragile. At the time, I
didn't know what he meant. It was hard to see clearly
because I was so afraid. Now I'm not. The Capitol's fragile
because it depends on the districts for everything. Food,
energy, even the Peacekeepers that police us. If we
declare our freedom, the Capitol collapses. President
Snow, thanks to you, I'm officially declaring mine today."
I've been sufficient, if not dazzling. Everyone loves the
bread story. But it's my message to President Snow that
gets the wheels spinning in Plutarch's brain. He hastily calls
Finnick and Haymitch over and they have a brief but intense
conversation that I can see Haymitch isn't happy with.
Plutarch seems to win--Finnick's pale but nodding his head
by the end of it.
As Finnick moves to take my seat before the camera,
Haymitch tells him, "You don't have to do this."
"Yes, I do. If it will help her." Finnick balls up his rope in
his hand. "I'm ready."
I don't know what to expect. A love story about Annie?
An account of the abuses in District 4? But Finnick Odair
takes a completely different tack.
"President Snow used to...sell me...my body, that is,"
Finnick begins in a flat, removed tone. "I wasn't the only
one. If a victor is considered desirable, the president gives
them as a reward or allows people to buy them for an
exorbitant amount of money. If you refuse, he kills someone
you love. So you do it."
That explains it, then. Finnick's parade of lovers in the
Capitol. They were never real lovers. Just people like our
old Head Peacekeeper, Cray, who bought desperate girls
to devour and discard because he could. I want to interrupt
the taping and beg Finnick's forgiveness for every false
thought I've ever had about him. But we have a job to do,
and I sense Finnick's role will be far more effective than
mine.
"I wasn't the only one, but I was the most popular," he
says. "And perhaps the most defenseless, because the
people I loved were so defenseless. To make themselves
feel better, my patrons would make presents of money or
jewelry, but I found a much more valuable form of payment."
Secrets, I think. That's what Finnick told me his lovers
paid him in, only I thought the whole arrangement was by
his choice.
"Secrets," he says, echoing my thoughts. "And this is
where you're going to want to stay tuned, President Snow,
because so very many of them were about you. But let's
begin with some of the others."
Finnick begins to weave a tapestry so rich in detail that
you can't doubt its authenticity. Tales of strange sexual
appetites, betrayals of the heart, bottomless greed, and
bloody power plays. Drunken secrets whispered over damp
pillow-cases in the dead of night. Finnick was someone
bought and sold. A district slave. A handsome one,
certainly, but in reality, harmless. Who would he tell? And
who would believe him if he did? But some secrets are too
delicious not to share. I don't know the people Finnick
names--all seem to be prominent Capitol citizens--but I
know, from listening to the chatter of my prep team, the
attention the most mild slip in judgment can draw. If a bad
haircut can lead to hours of gossip, what will charges of
incest, back-stabbing, blackmail, and arson produce? Even
as the waves of shock and recrimination roll over the
Capitol, the people there will be waiting, as I am now, to
hear about the president.
"And now, on to our good President Coriolanus
Snow," says Finnick. "Such a young man when he rose to
power. Such a clever one to keep it. How, you must ask
yourself, did he do it? One word. That's all you really need
to know. Poison." Finnick goes back to Snow's political
ascension, which I know nothing of, and works his way up to
the present, pointing out case after case of the mysterious
deaths of Snow's adversaries or, even worse, his allies
who had the potential to become threats. People dropping
dead at a feast or slowly, inexplicably declining into
shadows over a period of months. Blamed on bad shellfish,
elusive viruses, or an overlooked weakness in the aorta.
Snow drinking from the poisoned cup himself to deflect
suspicion. But antidotes don't always work. They say that's
why he wears the roses that reek of perfume. They say it's
to cover the scent of blood from the mouth sores that will
never heal. They say, they say, they say...Snow has a list
and no one knows who will be next.
Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake.
Since my opinion of the Capitol and its noble president
are already so low, I can't say Finnick's allegations shock
me. They seem to have far more effect on the displaced
Capitol rebels like my crew and Fulvia--even Plutarch
occasionally reacts in surprise, maybe wondering how a
specific tidbit passed him by. When Finnick finishes, they
just keep the cameras rolling until finally he has to be the
one to say "Cut."
The crew hurries inside to edit the material, and
Plutarch leads Finnick off for a chat, probably to see if he
has any more stories. I'm left with Haymitch in the rubble,
wondering if Finnick's fate would have one day been mine.
Why not? Snow could have gotten a really good price for
the girl on fire.
"Is that what happened to you?" I ask Haymitch.
"No. My mother and younger brother. My girl. They
were all dead two weeks after I was crowned victor.
Because of that stunt I pulled with the force field," he
answers. "Snow had no one to use against me."
"I'm surprised he didn't just kill you," I say.
"Oh, no. I was the example. The person to hold up to
the young Finnicks and Johannas and Cashmeres. Of what
could happen to a victor who caused problems," says
Haymitch. "But he knew he had no leverage against me."
"Until Peeta and I came along," I say softly. I don't even
get a shrug in return.
With our job done, there's nothing left for Finnick and
me to do but wait. We try to fill the dragging minutes in
Special Defense. Tie knots. Push our lunch around our
bowls. Blow things up on the shooting range. Because of
the danger of detection, no communication comes from the
rescue team. At 15:00, the designated hour, we stand
tense and silent in the back of a room full of screens and
computers and watch Beetee and his team try to dominate
the airwaves. His usual fidgety distraction is replaced with
a determination I have never seen. Most of my interview
doesn't make the cut, just enough to show I am alive and
still defiant. It is Finnick's salacious and gory account of the
Capitol that takes the day. Is Beetee's skill improving? Or
are his counterparts in the Capitol a little too fascinated to
want to tune Finnick out? For the next sixty minutes, the
Capitol feed alternates between the standard afternoon
newscast, Finnick, and attempts to black it all out. But the
rebel techno team manages to override even the latter and,
in a real coup, keeps control for almost the entire attack on
Snow.
"Let it go!" says Beetee, throwing up his hands,
relinquishing the broadcast back to the Capitol. He mops
his face with a cloth. "If they're not out of there by now,
they're all dead." He spins in his chair to see Finnick and
me reacting to his words. "It was a good plan, though. Did
Plutarch show it to you?"
Of course not. Beetee takes us to another room and
shows us how the team, with the help of rebel insiders, will
attempt--has attempted--to free the victors from an
underground prison. It seems to have involved knockout
gas distributed by the ventilation system, a power failure,
the detonation of a bomb in a government building several
miles from the prison, and now the disruption of the
broadcast. Beetee's glad we find the plan hard to follow,
because then our enemies will, too.
"Like your electricity trap in the arena?" I ask.
"Exactly. And see how well that worked out?" says
Beetee.
Well...not really, I think.
Finnick and I try to station ourselves in Command,
where surely first word of the rescue will come, but we are
barred because serious war business is being carried out.
We refuse to leave Special Defense and end up waiting in
the hummingbird room for news.
Making knots. Making knots. No word. Making knots.
Tick-tock. This is a clock. Do not think of Gale. Do not think
of Peeta. Making knots. We do not want dinner. Fingers
raw and bleeding. Finnick finally gives up and assumes the
hunched position he took in the arena when the jabberjays
attacked. I perfect my miniature noose. The words of "The
Hanging Tree" replay in my head. Gale and Peeta. Peeta
and Gale.
"Did you love Annie right away, Finnick?" I ask.
"No." A long time passes before he adds, "She crept
up on me."
I search my heart, but at the moment the only person I
can feel creeping up on me is Snow.
It must be midnight, it must be tomorrow when
Haymitch pushes open the door. "They're back. We're
wanted in the hospital." My mouth opens with a flood of
questions that he cuts off with "That's all I know."
I want to run, but Finnick's acting so strange, as if he's
lost the ability to move, so I take his hand and lead him like
a small child. Through Special Defense, into the elevator
that goes this way and that, and on to the hospital wing. The
place is in an uproar, with doctors shouting orders and the
wounded being wheeled through the halls in their beds.
We're sideswiped by a gurney bearing an
unconscious, emaciated young woman with a shaved head.
Her flesh shows bruises and oozing scabs. Johanna
Mason. Who actually knew rebel secrets. At least the one
about me. And this is how she has paid for it.
Through a doorway, I catch a glimpse of Gale, stripped
to the waist, perspiration streaming down his face as a
doctor removes something from under his shoulder blade
with a long pair of tweezers. Wounded, but alive. I call his
name, start toward him until a nurse pushes me back and
shuts me out.
"Finnick!" Something between a shriek and a cry of
joy. A lovely if somewhat bedraggled young woman--dark
tangled hair, sea green eyes--runs toward us in nothing but
a sheet. "Finnick!" And suddenly, it's as if there's no one in
the world but these two, crashing through space to reach
each other. They collide, enfold, lose their balance, and
slam against a wall, where they stay. Clinging into one
being. Indivisible.
A pang of jealousy hits me. Not for either Finnick or
Annie but for their certainty. No one seeing them could
doubt their love.
Boggs, looking a little worse for wear but uninjured,
finds Haymitch and me. "We got them all out. Except
Enobaria. But since she's from Two, we doubt she's being
held anyway. Peeta's at the end of the hall. The effects of
the gas are just wearing off. You should be there when he
wakes."
Peeta.
Alive and well--maybe not well but alive and here.
Away from Snow. Safe. Here. With me. In a minute I can
touch him. See his smile. Hear his laugh.
Haymitch's grinning at me. "Come on, then," he says.
I'm light-headed with giddiness. What will I say? Oh,
who cares what I say? Peeta will be ecstatic no matter what
I do. He'll probably be kissing me anyway. I wonder if it will
feel like those last kisses on the beach in the arena, the
ones I haven't dared let myself consider until this moment.
Peeta's awake already, sitting on the side of the bed,
looking bewildered as a trio of doctors reassure him, flash
lights in his eyes, check his pulse. I'm disappointed that
mine was not the first face he saw when he woke, but he
sees it now. His features register disbelief and something
more intense that I can't quite place. Desire? Desperation?
Surely both, for he sweeps the doctors aside, leaps to his
feet, and moves toward me. I run to meet him, my arms
extended to embrace him. His hands are reaching for me,
too, to caress my face, I think.
My lips are just forming his name when his fingers lock
around my throat.
13
The cold collar chafes my neck and makes the
shivering even harder to control. At least I am no longer in
the claustrophobic tube, while the machines click and whir
around me, listening to a disembodied voice telling me to
hold still while I try to convince myself I can still breathe.
Even now, when I've been assured there will be no
permanent damage, I hunger for air.
The medical team's main concerns--damage to my
spinal cord, airway, veins, and arteries--have been allayed.
Bruising, hoarseness, the sore larynx, this strange little
cough--not to be worried about. It will all be fine. The
Mockingjay will not lose her voice. Where, I want to ask, is
the doctor who determines if I am losing my mind? Only I'm
not supposed to talk right now. I can't even thank Boggs
when he comes to check on me. To look me over and tell
me he's seen a lot worse injuries among the soldiers when
they teach choke holds in training.
It was Boggs who knocked out Peeta with one blow
before any permanent damage could be done. I know
Haymitch would have come to my defense if he hadn't been
utterly unprepared. To catch both Haymitch and myself off
guard is a rare thing. But we have been so consumed with
saving Peeta, so tortured by having him in the Capitol's
hands, that the elation at having him back blinded us. If I'd
had a private reunion with Peeta, he would have killed me.
Now that he's deranged.
No, not deranged, I remind myself. Hijacked. That's
the word I heard pass between Plutarch and Haymitch as I
was wheeled past them in the hallway. Hijacked. I don't
know what it means.
Prim, who appeared moments after the attack and has
stayed as close to me as possible ever since, spreads
another blanket over me. "I think they'll take the collar off
soon, Katniss. You won't be so cold then." My mother,
who's been assisting in a complicated surgery, has still not
been informed of Peeta's assault. Prim takes one of my
hands, which is clutched in a fist, and massages it until it
opens and blood begins to flow through my fingers again.
She's starting on the second fist when the doctors show up,
remove the collar, and give me a shot of something for pain
and swelling. I lie, as instructed, with my head still, not
aggravating the injuries to my neck.
Plutarch, Haymitch, and Beetee have been waiting in
the hall for the doctors to give them clearance to see me. I
don't know if they've told Gale, but since he's not here, I
assume they haven't. Plutarch ushers the doctors out and
tries to order Prim to go as well, but she says, "No. If you
force me to leave, I'll go directly to surgery and tell my
mother everything that's happened. And I warn you, she
doesn't think much of a Gamemaker calling the shots on
Katniss's life. Especially when you've taken such poor care
of her."
Plutarch looks offended, but Haymitch chuckles. "I'd let
it go, Plutarch," he says. Prim stays.
"So, Katniss, Peeta's condition has come as a shock
to all of us," says Plutarch. "We couldn't help but notice his
deterioration in the last two interviews. Obviously, he'd
been abused, and we put his psychological state down to
that. Now we believe something more was going on. That
the Capitol has been subjecting him to a rather uncommon
technique known as hijacking. Beetee?"
"I'm sorry," Beetee says, "but I can't tell you all the
specifics of it, Katniss. The Capitol's very secretive about
this form of torture, and I believe the results are
inconsistent. This we do know. It's a type of fear
conditioning. The term hijack comes from an old English
word that means 'to capture,' or even better, 'seize.' We
believe it was chosen because the technique involves the
use of tracker jacker venom, and the jack suggested
hijack. You were stung in your first Hunger Games, so
unlike most of us, you have firsthand knowledge of the
effects of the venom."
Terror. Hallucinations. Nightmarish visions of losing
those I love. Because the venom targets the part of the
brain that houses fear.
"I'm sure you remember how frightening it was. Did you
also suffer mental confusion in the aftermath?" asks
Beetee. "A sense of being unable to judge what was true
and what was false? Most people who have been stung
and lived to tell about it report something of the kind."
Yes. That encounter with Peeta. Even after I was
clearheaded, I wasn't sure if he had saved my life by taking
on Cato or if I'd imagined it.
"Recall is made more difficult because memories can
be changed." Beetee taps his forehead. "Brought to the
forefront of your mind, altered, and saved again in the
revised form. Now imagine that I ask you to remember
something--either with a verbal suggestion or by making
you watch a tape of the event--and while that experience is
refreshed, I give you a dose of tracker jacker venom. Not
enough to induce a three-day blackout. Just enough to
infuse the memory with fear and doubt. And that's what your
brain puts in long-term storage."
I start to feel sick. Prim asks the question that's in my
mind. "Is that what they've done to Peeta? Taken his
memories of Katniss and distorted them so they're scary?"
Beetee nods. "So scary that he'd see her as lifethreatening.
That he might try to kill her. Yes, that's our
current theory."
I cover my face with my arms because this isn't
happening. It isn't possible. For someone to make Peeta
forget he loves me...no one could do that.
"But you can reverse it, right?" asks Prim.
"Um...very little data on that," says Plutarch. "None,
really. If hijacking rehabilitation has been attempted before,
we have no access to those records."
"Well, you're going to try, aren't you?" Prim persists.
"You're not just going to lock him up in some padded room
and leave him to suffer?"
"Of course, we'll try, Prim," says Beetee. "It's just, we
don't know to what degree we'll succeed. If any. My guess
is that fearful events are the hardest to root out. They're the
ones we naturally remember the best, after all."
"And apart from his memories of Katniss, we don't yet
know what else has been tampered with," says Plutarch.
"We're putting together a team of mental health and military
professionals to come up with a counterattack. I, personally,
feel optimistic that he'll make a full recovery."
"Do you?" asks Prim caustically. "And what do you
think, Haymitch?"
I shift my arms slightly so I can see his expression
through the crack. He's exhausted and discouraged as he
admits, "I think Peeta might get somewhat better. But...I
don't think he'll ever be the same." I snap my arms back
together, closing the crack, shutting them all out.
"At least he's alive," says Plutarch, as if he's losing
patience with the lot of us. "Snow executed Peeta's stylist
and his prep team on live television tonight. We've no idea
what happened to Effie Trinket. Peeta's damaged, but he's
here. With us. And that's a definite improvement over his
situation twelve hours ago. Let's keep that in mind, all
right?"
Plutarch's attempt to cheer me up--laced with the news
of another four, possibly five, murders--somehow backfires.
Portia. Peeta's prep team. Effie. The effort to fight back
tears makes my throat throb until I'm gasping again.
Eventually, they have no choice but to sedate me.
When I wake, I wonder if this will be the only way I
sleep now, with drugs shot into my arm. I'm glad I'm not
supposed to talk for the next few days, because there's
nothing I want to say. Or do. In fact, I'm a model patient, my
lethargy taken for restraint, obedience to the doctors'
orders. I no longer feel like crying. In fact, I can only manage
to hold on to one simple thought: an image of Snow's face
accompanied by the whisper in my head. I will kill you.
My mother and Prim take turns nursing me, coaxing
me to swallow bites of soft food. People come in
periodically to give me updates on Peeta's condition. The
high levels of tracker jacker venom are working their way
out of his body. He's being treated only by strangers,
natives of 13--no one from home or the Capitol has been
allowed to see him--to keep any dangerous memories from
triggering. A team of specialists works long hours
designing a strategy for his recovery.
Gale's not supposed to visit me, as he's confined to
bed with some kind of shoulder wound. But on the third
night, after I've been medicated and the lights turned down
low for bedtime, he slips silently into my room. He doesn't
speak, just runs his fingers over the bruises on my neck
with a touch as light as moth wings, plants a kiss between
my eyes, and disappears.
The next morning, I'm discharged from the hospital with
instructions to move quietly and speak only when
necessary. I'm not imprinted with a schedule, so I wander
around aimlessly until Prim's excused from her hospital
duties to take me to our family's latest compartment. 2212.
Identical to the last one, but with no window.
Buttercup has now been issued a daily food allowance
and a pan of sand that's kept under the bathroom sink. As
Prim tucks me into bed, he hops up on my pillow, vying for
her attention. She cradles him but stays focused on me.
"Katniss, I know this whole thing with Peeta is terrible for
you. But remember, Snow worked on him for weeks, and
we've only had him for a few days. There's a chance that
the old Peeta, the one who loves you, is still inside. Trying
to get back to you. Don't give up on him."
I look at my little sister and think how she has inherited
the best qualities our family has to offer: my mother's
healing hands, my father's level head, and my fight. There's
something else there as well, something entirely her own.
An ability to look into the confusing mess of life and see
things for what they are. Is it possible she could be right?
That Peeta could return to me?
"I have to get back to the hospital," Prim says, placing
Buttercup on the bed beside me. "You two keep each other
company, okay?"
Buttercup springs off the bed and follows her to the
door, complaining loudly when he's left behind. We're about
as much company for each other as dirt. After maybe thirty
seconds, I know I can't stand being confined in the
subterranean cell, and leave Buttercup to his own devices. I
get lost several times, but eventually I make my way down
to Special Defense. Everyone I pass stares at the bruises,
and I can't help feeling self-conscious to the point that I tug
my collar up to my ears.
Gale must have been released from the hospital this
morning as well, because I find him in one of the research
rooms with Beetee. They're immersed, heads bent over a
drawing, taking a measurement. Versions of the picture
litter the table and floor. Tacked on the corkboard walls and
occupying several computer screens are other designs of
some sort. In the rough lines of one, I recognize Gale's
twitch-up snare. "What are these?" I ask hoarsely, pulling
their attention from the sheet.
"Ah, Katniss, you've found us out," says Beetee
cheerfully.
"What? Is this a secret?" I know Gale's been down
here working with Beetee a lot, but I assumed they were
messing around with bows and guns.
"Not really. But I've felt a little guilty about it. Stealing
Gale away from you so much," Beetee admits.
Since I've spent most of my time in 13 disoriented,
worried, angry, being remade, or hospitalized, I can't say
Gale's absences have inconvenienced me. Things haven't
been exactly harmonious between us, either. But I let
Beetee think he owes me. "I hope you've been putting his
time to good use."
"Come and see," he says, waving me over to a
computer screen.
This is what they've been doing. Taking the
fundamental ideas behind Gale's traps and adapting them
into weapons against humans. Bombs mostly. It's less
about the mechanics of the traps than the psychology
behind them. Booby-trapping an area that provides
something essential to survival. A water or food supply.
Frightening prey so that a large number flee into a greater
destruction. Endangering off-spring in order to draw in the
actual desired target, the parent. Luring the victim into what
appears to be a safe haven--where death awaits it. At
some point, Gale and Beetee left the wilderness behind
and focused on more human impulses. Like compassion. A
bomb explodes. Time is allowed for people to rush to the
aid of the wounded. Then a second, more powerful bomb
kills them as well.
"That seems to be crossing some kind of line," I say.
"So anything goes?" They both stare at me--Beetee with
doubt, Gale with hostility. "I guess there isn't a rule book for
what might be unacceptable to do to another human being."
"Sure there is. Beetee and I have been following the
same rule book President Snow used when he hijacked
Peeta," says Gale.
Cruel, but to the point. I leave without further comment. I
feel if I don't get outside immediately, I'll just go ballistic, but
I'm still in Special Defense when I'm waylaid by Haymitch.
"Come on," he says. "We need you back up at the
hospital."
"What for?" I ask.
"They're going to try something on Peeta," he answers.
"Send in the most innocuous person from Twelve they can
come up with. Find someone Peeta might share childhood
memories with, but nothing too close to you. They're
screening people now."
I know this will be a difficult task, since anyone Peeta
shares childhood memories with would most likely be from
town, and almost none of those people escaped the
flames. But when we reach the hospital room that has been
turned into a work space for Peeta's recovery team, there
she sits chatting with Plutarch. Delly Cartwright. As always,
she gives me a smile that suggests I'm her best friend in
the world. She gives this smile to everyone. "Katniss!" she
calls out.
"Hey, Delly," I say. I'd heard she and her younger
brother had survived. Her parents, who ran the shoe shop in
town, weren't as lucky. She looks older, wearing the drab
13 clothes that flatter no one, with her long yellow hair in a
practical braid instead of curls. Delly's a bit thinner than I
remember, but she was one of the few kids in District 12
with a couple of pounds to spare. The diet here, the stress,
the grief of losing her parents have all, no doubt,
contributed. "How are you doing?" I ask.
"Oh, it's been a lot of changes all at once." Her eyes fill
with tears. "But everyone's really nice here in Thirteen, don't
you think?"
Delly means it. She genuinely likes people. All people,
not just a select few she's spent years making up her mind
about.
"They've made an effort to make us feel welcome," I
say. I think that's a fair statement without going overboard.
"Are you the one they've picked to see Peeta?"
"I guess so. Poor Peeta. Poor you. I'll never
understand the Capitol," she says.
"Better not to, maybe," I tell her.
"Delly's known Peeta for a long time," says Plutarch.
"Oh, yes!" Delly's face brightens. "We played together
from when we were little. I used to tell people he was my
brother."
"What do you think?" Haymitch asks me. "Anything that
might trigger memories of you?"
"We were all in the same class. But we never
overlapped much," I say.
"Katniss was always so amazing, I never dreamed she
would notice me," says Delly. "The way she could hunt and
go in the Hob and everything. Everyone admired her so."
Haymitch and I both have to take a hard look at her
face to double-check if she's joking. To hear Delly describe
it, I had next to no friends because I intimidated people by
being so exceptional. Not true. I had next to no friends
because I wasn't friendly. Leave it to Delly to spin me into
something wonderful.
"Delly always thinks the best of everyone," I explain. "I
don't think Peeta could have bad memories associated
with her." Then I remember. "Wait. In the Capitol. When I
lied about recognizing the Avox girl. Peeta covered for me
and said she looked like Delly."
"I remember," says Haymitch. "But I don't know. It
wasn't true. Delly wasn't actually there. I don't think it can
compete with years of childhood memories."
"Especially with such a pleasant companion as Delly,"
says Plutarch. "Let's give it a shot."
Plutarch, Haymitch, and I go to the observation room
next to where Peeta's confined. It's crowded with ten
members of his recovery team armed with pens and
clipboards. The one-way glass and audio setup allow us to
watch Peeta secretly. He lies on the bed, his arms
strapped down. He doesn't fight the restraints, but his
hands fidget continuously. His expression seems more
lucid than when he tried to strangle me, but it's still not one
that belongs to him.
When the door quietly opens, his eyes widen in alarm,
then become confused. Delly crosses the room tentatively,
but as she nears him she naturally breaks into a smile.
"Peeta? It's Delly. From home."
"Delly?" Some of the clouds seem to clear. "Delly. It's
you."
"Yes!" she says with obvious relief. "How do you feel?"
"Awful. Where are we? What's happened?" asks
Peeta.
"Here we go," says Haymitch.
"I told her to steer clear of any mention of Katniss or
the Capitol," says Plutarch. "Just see how much of home
she could conjure up."
"Well...we're in District Thirteen. We live here now,"
says Delly.
"That's what those people have been saying. But it
makes no sense. Why aren't we home?" asks Peeta.
Delly bites her lip. "There was...an accident. I miss
home badly, too. I was only just thinking about those chalk
drawings we used to do on the paving stones. Yours were
so wonderful. Remember when you made each one a
different animal?"
"Yeah. Pigs and cats and things," says Peeta. "You
said...about an accident?"
I can see the sheen of sweat on Delly's forehead as
she tries to work around the question. "It was bad. No
one...could stay," she says haltingly.
"Hang in there, girl," says Haymitch.
"But I know you're going to like it here, Peeta. The
people have been really nice to us. There's always food
and clean clothes, and school's much more interesting,"
says Delly.
"Why hasn't my family come to see me?" Peeta asks.
"They can't." Delly's tearing up again. "A lot of people
didn't get out of Twelve. So we'll need to make a new life
here. I'm sure they could use a good baker. Do you
remember when your father used to let us make dough girls
and boys?"
"There was a fire," Peeta says suddenly.
"Yes," she whispers.
"Twelve burned down, didn't it? Because of her," says
Peeta angrily. "Because of Katniss!" He begins to pull on
the restraints.
"Oh, no, Peeta. It wasn't her fault," says Delly.
"Did she tell you that?" he hisses at her.
"Get her out of there," says Plutarch. The door opens
immediately and Delly begins to back toward it slowly.
"She didn't have to. I was--" Delly begins.
"Because she's lying! She's a liar! You can't believe
anything she says! She's some kind of mutt the Capitol
created to use against the rest of us!" Peeta shouts.
"No, Peeta. She's not a--" Delly tries again.
"Don't trust her, Delly," says Peeta in a frantic voice. "I
did, and she tried to kill me. She killed my friends. My
family. Don't even go near her! She's a mutt!"
A hand reaches through the doorway, pulls Delly out,
and the door swings shut. But Peeta keeps yelling. "A mutt!
She's a stinking mutt!"
Not only does he hate me and want to kill me, he no
longer believes I'm human. It was less painful being
strangled.
Around me the recovery team members scribble like
crazy, taking down every word. Haymitch and Plutarch grab
my arms and propel me out of the room. They lean me up
against a wall in the silent hallway. But I know Peeta
continues to scream behind the door and the glass.
Prim was wrong. Peeta is irretrievable. "I can't stay
here anymore," I say numbly. "If you want me to be the
Mockingjay, you'll have to send me away."
"Where do you want to go?" asks Haymitch.
"The Capitol." It's the only place I can think of where I
have a job to do.
"Can't do it," Plutarch says. "Not until all the districts
are secure. Good news is, the fighting's almost over in all of
them but Two. It's a tough nut to crack, though."
That's right. First the districts. Next the Capitol. And
then I hunt down Snow.
"Fine," I say. "Send me to Two."
14
District 2 is a large district, as one might expect,
composed of a series of villages spread across the
mountains. Each was originally associated with a mine or
quarry, although now, many are devoted to the housing and
training of Peacekeepers. None of this would present much
of a challenge, since the rebels have 13's airpower on their
side, except for one thing: At the center of the district is a
virtually impenetrable mountain that houses the heart of the
Capitol's military.
We've nicknamed the mountain the Nut since I relayed
Plutarch's "tough nut to crack" comment to the weary and
discouraged rebel leaders here. The Nut was established
directly after the Dark Days, when the Capitol had lost 13
and was desperate for a new underground stronghold. They
had some of their military resources situated on the
outskirts of the Capitol itself--nuclear missiles, aircraft,
troops--but a significant chunk of their power was now
under an enemy's control. Of course, there was no way they
could hope to replicate 13, which was the work of centuries.
However, in the old mines of nearby District 2, they saw
opportunity. From the air, the Nut appeared to be just
another mountain with a few entrances on its faces. But
inside were vast cavernous spaces where slabs of stones
had been cut, hauled to the surface, and transported down
slippery narrow roads to make distant buildings. There was
even a train system to facilitate transporting the miners
from the Nut to the very center of the main town in District 2.
It ran right to the square that Peeta and I visited during the
Victory Tour, standing on the wide marble steps of the
Justice Building, trying not to look too closely at Cato's and
Clove's grieving families assembled below us.
It was not the most ideal terrain, plagued as it was by
mudslides, floods, and avalanches. But the advantages
outweighed the concerns. As they'd cut deep into the
mountain, the miners had left large pillars and walls of stone
to support the infrastructure. The Capitol reinforced these
and set about making the mountain their new military base.
Filling it with computer banks and meeting rooms, barracks
and arsenals. Widening entrances to allow the exit of
hovercraft from the hangar, installing missile launchers. But
on the whole, leaving the exterior of the mountain largely
unchanged. A rough, rocky tangle of trees and wildlife. A
natural fortress to protect them from their enemies.
By the other districts' standards, the Capitol babied
the inhabitants here. Just by looking at the District 2 rebels,
you can tell they were decently fed and cared for in
childhood. Some did end up as quarry and mine workers.
Others were educated for jobs in the Nut or funneled into
the ranks of Peacekeepers. Trained young and hard for
combat. The Hunger Games were an opportunity for wealth
and a kind of glory not seen elsewhere. Of course, the
people of 2 swallowed the Capitol's propaganda more
easily than the rest of us. Embraced their ways. But for all
that, at the end of the day, they were still slaves. And if that
was lost on the citizens who became Peacekeepers or
worked in the Nut, it was not lost on the stonecutters who
formed the backbone of the resistance here.
Things stand as they did when I arrived two weeks
ago. The outer villages are in rebel hands, the town divided,
and the Nut is as untouchable as ever. Its few entrances
heavily fortified, its heart safely enfolded in the mountain.
While every other district has now wrested control from the
Capitol, 2 remains in its pocket.
Each day, I do whatever I can to help. Visit the
wounded. Tape short propos with my camera crew. I'm not
allowed in actual combat, but they invite me to the meetings
on the status of the war, which is a lot more than they did in
13. It's much better here. Freer, no schedules on my arm,
fewer demands on my time. I live aboveground in the rebel
villages or surrounding caves. For safety's sake, I'm
relocated often. During the day, I've been given clearance
to hunt as long as I take a guard along and don't stray too
far. In the thin, cold mountain air, I feel some physical
strength returning, my mind clearing away the rest of the
fogginess. But with this mental clarity comes an even
sharper awareness of what has been done to Peeta.
Snow has stolen him from me, twisted him beyond
recognition, and made me a present of him. Boggs, who
came to 2 when I did, told me that even with all the plotting,
it was a little too easy to rescue Peeta. He believes if 13
hadn't made the effort, Peeta would've been delivered to
me anyway. Dropped off in an actively warring district or
perhaps 13 itself. Tied up with ribbons and tagged with my
name. Programmed to murder me.
It's only now that he's been corrupted that I can fully
appreciate the real Peeta. Even more than I would've if he'd
died. The kindness, the steadiness, the warmth that had an
unexpected heat behind it. Outside of Prim, my mother, and
Gale, how many people in the world love me
unconditionally? I think in my case, the answer may now be
none. Sometimes when I'm alone, I take the pearl from
where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with
the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on
the train, the kisses in the arena. To make myself put a
name to the thing I've lost. But what's the use? It's gone.
He's gone. Whatever existed between us is gone. All that's
left is my promise to kill Snow. I tell myself this ten times a
day.
Back in 13, Peeta's rehabilitation continues. Even
though I don't ask, Plutarch gives me cheerful updates on
the phone like "Good news, Katniss! I think we've almost
got him convinced you're not a mutt!" Or "Today he was
allowed to feed himself pudding!"
When Haymitch gets on after, he admits Peeta's no
better. The only dubious ray of hope has come from my
sister. "Prim came up with the idea of trying to hijack him
back," Haymitch tells me. "Bring up the distorted memories
of you and then give him a big dose of a calming drug, like
morphling. We've only tried it on one memory. The tape of
the two of you in the cave, when you told him that story
about getting Prim the goat."
"Any improvement?" I ask.
"Well, if extreme confusion is an improvement over
extreme terror, then yes," says Haymitch. "But I'm not sure it
is. He lost the ability to speak for several hours. Went into
some sort of stupor. When he came out, the only thing he
asked about was the goat."
"Right," I say.
"How's it out there?" he asks.
"No forward motion," I tell him.
"We're sending out a team to help with the mountain.
Beetee and some of the others," he says. "You know, the
brains."
When the brains are selected, I'm not surprised to see
Gale's name on the list. I thought Beetee would bring him,
not for his technological expertise, but in the hopes that he
could somehow think of a way to ensnare a mountain.
Originally, Gale offered to come with me to 2, but I could
see I was tearing him away from his work with Beetee. I told
him to sit tight and stay where he was most needed. I didn't
tell him his presence would make it even more difficult for
me to mourn Peeta.
Gale finds me when they arrive late one afternoon. I'm
sitting on a log at the edge of my current village, plucking a
goose. A dozen or so of the birds are piled at my feet.
Great flocks of them have been migrating through here
since I've arrived, and the pickings are easy. Without a
word, Gale settles beside me and begins to relieve a bird
of its feathers. We're through about half when he says, "Any
chance we'll get to eat these?"
"Yeah. Most go to the camp kitchen, but they expect
me to give a couple to whoever I'm staying with tonight," I
say. "For keeping me."
"Isn't the honor of the thing enough?" he says.
"You'd think," I reply. "But word's gotten out that
mockingjays are hazardous to your health."
We pluck in silence for a while longer. Then he says, "I
saw Peeta yesterday. Through the glass."
"What'd you think?" I ask.
"Something selfish," says Gale.
"That you don't have to be jealous of him anymore?"
My fingers give a yank, and a cloud of feathers floats down
around us.
"No. Just the opposite." Gale pulls a feather out of my
hair. "I thought...I'll never compete with that. No matter how
much pain I'm in." He spins the feather between his thumb
and forefinger. "I don't stand a chance if he doesn't get
better. You'll never be able to let him go. You'll always feel
wrong about being with me."
"The way I always felt wrong kissing him because of
you," I say.
Gale holds my gaze. "If I thought that was true, I could
almost live with the rest of it."
"It is true," I admit. "But so is what you said about
Peeta."
Gale makes a sound of exasperation. Nonetheless,
after we've dropped off the birds and volunteered to go
back to the woods to gather kindling for the evening fire, I
find myself wrapped in his arms. His lips brushing the faded
bruises on my neck, working their way to my mouth.
Despite what I feel for Peeta, this is when I accept deep
down that he'll never come back to me. Or I'll never go back
to him. I'll stay in 2 until it falls, go to the Capitol and kill
Snow, and then die for my trouble. And he'll die insane and
hating me. So in the fading light I shut my eyes and kiss
Gale to make up for all the kisses I've withheld, and
because it doesn't matter anymore, and because I'm so
desperately lonely I can't stand it.
Gale's touch and taste and heat remind me that at
least my body's still alive, and for the moment it's a
welcome feeling. I empty my mind and let the sensations
run through my flesh, happy to lose myself. When Gale pulls
away slightly, I move forward to close the gap, but I feel his
hand under my chin. "Katniss," he says. The instant I open
my eyes, the world seems disjointed. This is not our woods
or our mountains or our way. My hand automatically goes to
the scar on my left temple, which I associate with confusion.
"Now kiss me." Bewildered, unblinking, I stand there while
he leans in and presses his lips to mine briefly. He
examines my face closely. "What's going on in your head?"
"I don't know," I whisper back.
"Then it's like kissing someone who's drunk. It doesn't
count," he says with a weak attempt at a laugh. He scoops
up a pile of kindling and drops it in my empty arms,
returning me to myself.
"How do you know?" I say, mostly to cover my
embarrassment. "Have you kissed someone who's drunk?"
I guess Gale could've been kissing girls right and left back
in 12. He certainly had enough takers. I never thought about
it much before.
He just shakes his head. "No. But it's not hard to
imagine."
"So, you never kissed any other girls?" I ask.
"I didn't say that. You know, you were only twelve when
we met. And a real pain besides. I did have a life outside of
hunting with you," he says, loading up with firewood.
Suddenly, I'm genuinely curious. "Who did you kiss?
And where?"
"Too many to remember. Behind the school, on the
slag heap, you name it," he says.
I roll my eyes. "So when did I become so special?
When they carted me off to the Capitol?"
"No. About six months before that. Right after New
Year's. We were in the Hob, eating some slop of Greasy
Sae's. And Darius was teasing you about trading a rabbit
for one of his kisses. And I realized...I minded," he tells me.
I remember that day. Bitter cold and dark by four in the
afternoon. We'd been hunting, but a heavy snow had driven
us back into town. The Hob was crowded with people
looking for refuge from the weather. Greasy Sae's soup,
made with stock from the bones of a wild dog we'd shot a
week earlier, was below her usual standards. Still, it was
hot, and I was starving as I scooped it up, sitting crosslegged
on her counter. Darius was leaning on the post of
the stall, tickling my cheek with the end of my braid, while I
smacked his hand away. He was explaining why one of his
kisses merited a rabbit, or possibly two, since everyone
knows redheaded men are the most virile. And Greasy Sae
and I were laughing because he was so ridiculous and
persistent and kept pointing out women around the Hob
who he said had paid far more than a rabbit to enjoy his
lips. "See? The one in the green muffler? Go ahead and
ask her. If you need a reference."
A million miles from here, a billion days ago, this
happened. "Darius was just joking around," I say.
"Probably. Although you'd be the last to figure out if he
wasn't," Gale tells me. "Take Peeta. Take me. Or even
Finnick. I was starting to worry he had his eye on you, but
he seems back on track now."
"You don't know Finnick if you think he'd love me," I
say.
Gale shrugs. "I know he was desperate. That makes
people do all kinds of crazy things."
I can't help thinking that's directed at me.
Bright and early the next morning, the brains assemble
to take on the problem of the Nut. I'm asked to the meeting,
although I don't have much to contribute. I avoid the
conference table and perch in the wide windowsill that has
a view of the mountain in question. The commander from 2,
a middle-aged woman named Lyme, takes us on a virtual
tour of the Nut, its interior and fortifications, and recounts
the failed attempts to seize it. I've crossed paths with her
briefly a couple of times since my arrival, and was dogged
by the feeling I'd met her before. She's memorable enough,
standing over six feet tall and heavily muscled. But it's only
when I see a clip of her in the field, leading a raid on the
main entrance of the Nut, that something clicks and I realize
I'm in the presence of another victor. Lyme, the tribute from
District 2, who won her Hunger Games over a generation
ago. Effie sent us her tape, among others, to prepare for
the Quarter Quell. I've probably caught glimpses of her
during the Games over the years, but she's kept a low
profile. With my newfound knowledge of Haymitch's and
Finnick's treatment, all I can think is: What did the Capitol
do to her after she won?
When Lyme finishes the presentation, the questions
from the brains begin. Hours pass, and lunch comes and
goes, as they try to come up with a realistic plan for taking
the Nut. But while Beetee thinks he might be able to
override certain computer systems, and there's some
discussion of putting the handful of internal spies to use, no
one has any really innovative thoughts. As the afternoon
wears on, talk keeps returning to a strategy that has been
tried repeatedly--the storming of the entrances. I can see
Lyme's frustration building because so many variations of
this plan have already failed, so many of her soldiers have
been lost. Finally, she bursts out, "The next person who
suggests we take the entrances better have a brilliant way
to do it, because you're going to be the one leading that
mission!"
Gale, who is too restless to sit at the table for more
than a few hours, has been alternating between pacing and
sharing my windowsill. Early on, he seemed to accept
Lyme's assertion that the entrances couldn't be taken, and
dropped out of the conversation entirely. For the last hour or
so, he's sat quietly, his brow knitted in concentration,
staring at the Nut through the window glass. In the silence
that follows Lyme's ultimatum, he speaks up. "Is it really so
necessary that we take the Nut? Or would it be enough to
disable it?"
"That would be a step in the right direction," says
Beetee. "What do you have in mind?"
"Think of it as a wild dog den," Gale continues. "You're
not going to fight your way in. So you have two choices.
Trap the dogs inside or flush them out."
"We've tried bombing the entrances," says Lyme.
"They're set too far inside the stone for any real damage to
be done."
"I wasn't thinking of that," says Gale. "I was thinking of
using the mountain." Beetee rises and joins Gale at the
window, peering through his ill-fitting glasses. "See?
Running down the sides?"
"Avalanche paths," says Beetee under his breath. "It'd
be tricky. We'd have to design the detonation sequence
with great care, and once it's in motion, we couldn't hope to
control it."
"We don't need to control it if we give up the idea that
we have to possess the Nut," says Gale. "Only shut it
down."
"So you're suggesting we start avalanches and block
the entrances?" asks Lyme.
"That's it," says Gale. "Trap the enemy inside, cut off
from supplies. Make it impossible for them to send out their
hovercraft."
While everyone considers the plan, Boggs flips
through a stack of blueprints of the Nut and frowns. "You
risk killing everyone inside. Look at the ventilation system.
It's rudimentary at best. Nothing like what we have in
Thirteen. It depends entirely on pumping in air from the
mountainsides. Block those vents and you'll suffocate
whoever is trapped."
"They could still escape through the train tunnel to the
square," says Beetee.
"Not if we blow it up," says Gale brusquely. His intent,
his full intent, becomes clear. Gale has no interest in
preserving the lives of those in the Nut. No interest in
caging the prey for later use.
This is one of his death traps.
15
The implications of what Gale is suggesting settle
quietly around the room. You can see the reaction playing
out on people's faces. The expressions range from
pleasure to distress, from sorrow to satisfaction.
"The majority of the workers are citizens from Two,"
says Beetee neutrally.
"So what?" says Gale. "We'll never be able to trust
them again."
"They should at least have a chance to surrender,"
says Lyme.
"Well, that's a luxury we weren't given when they firebombed
Twelve, but you're all so much cozier with the
Capitol here," says Gale. By the look on Lyme's face, I think
she might shoot him, or at least take a swing. She'd
probably have the upper hand, too, with all her training. But
her anger only seems to infuriate him and he yells, "We
watched children burn to death and there was nothing we
could do!"
I have to close my eyes a minute, as the image rips
through me. It has the desired effect. I want everyone in that
mountain dead. Am about to say so. But then...I'm also a
girl from District 12. Not President Snow. I can't help it. I
can't condemn someone to the death he's suggesting.
"Gale," I say, taking his arm and trying to speak in a
reasonable tone. "The Nut's an old mine. It'd be like
causing a massive coal mining accident." Surely the words
are enough to make anyone from 12 think twice about the
plan.
"But not so quick as the one that killed our fathers," he
retorts. "Is that everyone's problem? That our enemies
might have a few hours to reflect on the fact that they're
dying, instead of just being blown to bits?"
Back in the old days, when we were nothing more than
a couple of kids hunting outside of 12, Gale said things like
this and worse. But then they were just words. Here, put into
practice, they become deeds that can never be reversed.
"You don't know how those District Two people ended
up in the Nut," I say. "They may have been coerced. They
may be held against their will. Some are our own spies. Will
you kill them, too?"
"I would sacrifice a few, yes, to take out the rest of
them," he replies. "And if I were a spy in there, I'd say,
'Bring on the avalanches!'"
I know he's telling the truth. That Gale would sacrifice
his life in this way for the cause--no one doubts it. Perhaps
we'd all do the same if we were the spies and given the
choice. I guess I would. But it's a coldhearted decision to
make for other people and those who love them.
"You said we had two choices," Boggs tells him. "To
trap them or to flush them out. I say we try to avalanche the
mountain but leave the train tunnel alone. People can
escape into the square, where we'll be waiting for them."
"Heavily armed, I hope," says Gale. "You can be sure
they'll be."
"Heavily armed. We'll take them prisoner," agrees
Boggs.
"Let's bring Thirteen into the loop now," Beetee
suggests. "Let President Coin weigh in."
"She'll want to block the tunnel," says Gale with
conviction.
"Yes, most likely. But you know, Peeta did have a point
in his propos. About the dangers of killing ourselves off. I've
been playing with some numbers. Factoring in the
casualties and the wounded and...I think it's at least worth a
conversation," says Beetee.
Only a handful of people are invited to be part of that
conversation. Gale and I are released with the rest. I take
him hunting so he can blow off some steam, but he's not
talking about it. Probably too angry with me for countering
him.
The call does happen, a decision is made, and by
evening I'm suited up in my Mockingjay outfit, with my bow
slung over my shoulder and an earpiece that connects me
to Haymitch in 13--just in case a good opportunity for a
propo arises. We wait on the roof of the Justice Building
with a clear view of our target.
Our hoverplanes are initially ignored by the
commanders in the Nut, because in the past they've been
little more trouble than flies buzzing around a honeypot. But
after two rounds of bombings in the higher elevations of the
mountain, the planes have their attention. By the time the
Capitol's antiaircraft weapons begin to fire, it's already too
late.
Gale's plan exceeds anyone's expectations. Beetee
was right about being unable to control the avalanches
once they'd been set in motion. The mountainsides are
naturally unstable, but weakened by the explosions, they
seem almost fluid. Whole sections of the Nut collapse
before our eyes, obliterating any sign that human beings
have ever set foot on the place. We stand speechless, tiny
and insignificant, as waves of stone thunder down the
mountain. Burying the entrances under tons of rock. Raising
a cloud of dirt and debris that blackens the sky. Turning the
Nut into a tomb.
I imagine the hell inside the mountain. Sirens wailing.
Lights flickering into darkness. Stone dust choking the air.
The shrieks of panicked, trapped beings stumbling madly
for a way out, only to find the entrances, the launchpad, the
ventilation shafts themselves clogged with earth and rock
trying to force its way in. Live wires flung free, fires breaking
out, rubble making a familiar path a maze. People
slamming, shoving, scrambling like ants as the hill presses
in, threatening to crush their fragile shells.
"Katniss?" Haymitch's voice is in my earpiece. I try to
answer back and find both of my hands are clamped tightly
over my mouth. "Katniss!"
On the day my father died, the sirens went off during
my school lunch. No one waited for dismissal, or was
expected to. The response to a mine accident was
something outside the control of even the Capitol. I ran to
Prim's class. I still remember her, tiny at seven, very pale,
but sitting straight up with her hands folded on her desk.
Waiting for me to collect her as I'd promised I would if the
sirens ever sounded. She sprang out of her seat, grabbed
my coat sleeve, and we wove through the streams of
people pouring out onto the streets to pool at the main
entrance of the mine. We found our mother clenching the
rope that had been hastily strung to keep the crowd back. In
retrospect, I guess I should have known there was a
problem right then. Because why were we looking for her,
when the reverse should have been true?
The elevators were screeching, burning up and down
their cables as they vomited smoke-blackened miners into
the light of day. With each group came cries of relief,
relatives diving under the rope to lead off their husbands,
wives, children, parents, siblings. We stood in the freezing
air as the afternoon turned overcast, a light snow dusted the
earth. The elevators moved more slowly now and
disgorged fewer beings. I knelt on the ground and pressed
my hands into the cinders, wanting so badly to pull my
father free. If there's a more helpless feeling than trying to
reach someone you love who's trapped underground, I don't
know it. The wounded. The bodies. The waiting through the
night. Blankets put around your shoulders by strangers. A
mug of something hot that you don't drink. And then finally,
at dawn, the grieved expression on the face of the mine
captain that could only mean one thing.
What did we just do?
"Katniss! Are you there?" Haymitch is probably
making plans to have me fitted for a head shackle at this
very moment.
I drop my hands. "Yes."
"Get inside. Just in case the Capitol tries to retaliate
with what's left of its air force," he instructs.
"Yes," I repeat. Everyone on the roof, except for the
soldiers manning the machine guns, begin to make their
way inside. As I descend the stairs, I can't help brushing my
fingers along the unblemished white marble walls. So cold
and beautiful. Even in the Capitol, there's nothing to match
the magnificence of this old building. But there is no give to
the surface--only my flesh yields, my warmth taken. Stone
conquers people every time.
I sit at the base of one of the gigantic pillars in the
great entrance hall. Through the doors I can see the white
expanse of marble that leads to the steps on the square. I
remember how sick I was the day Peeta and I accepted
congratulations there for winning the Games. Worn down by
the Victory Tour, failing in my attempt to calm the districts,
facing the memories of Clove and Cato, particularly Cato's
gruesome, slow death by mutts.
Boggs crouches down beside me, his skin pale in the
shadows. "We didn't bomb the train tunnel, you know.
Some of them will probably get out."
"And then we'll shoot them when they show their
faces?" I ask.
"Only if we have to," he answers.
"We could send in trains ourselves. Help evacuate the
wounded," I say.
"No. It was decided to leave the tunnel in their hands.
That way they can use all the tracks to bring people out,"
says Boggs. "Besides, it will give us time to get the rest of
our soldiers to the square."
A few hours ago, the square was a no-man's-land, the
front line of the fight between the rebels and the
Peacekeepers. When Coin gave approval for Gale's plan,
the rebels launched a heated attack and drove the Capitol
forces back several blocks so that we would control the
train station in the event that the Nut fell. Well, it's fallen. The
reality has sunk in. Any survivors will escape to the square. I
can hear the gunfire starting again, as the Peacekeepers
are no doubt trying to fight their way in to rescue their
comrades. Our own soldiers are being brought in to counter
this.
"You're cold," says Boggs. "I'll see if I can find a
blanket." He goes before I can protest. I don't want a
blanket, even if the marble continues to leech my body heat.
"Katniss," says Haymitch in my ear.
"Still here," I answer.
"Interesting turn of events with Peeta this afternoon.
Thought you'd want to know," he says. Interesting isn't
good. It isn't better. But I don't really have any choice but to
listen. "We showed him that clip of you singing 'The
Hanging Tree.' It was never aired, so the Capitol couldn't
use it when he was being hijacked. He says he recognized
the song."
For a moment, my heart skips a beat. Then I realize it's
just more tracker jacker serum confusion. "He couldn't,
Haymitch. He never heard me sing that song."
"Not you. Your father. He heard him singing it one day
when he came to trade at the bakery. Peeta was small,
probably six or seven, but he remembered it because he
was specially listening to see if the birds stopped singing,"
says Haymitch. "Guess they did."
Six or seven. That would have been before my mother
banned the song. Maybe even right around the time I was
learning it. "Was I there, too?"
"Don't think so. No mention of you anyway. But it's the
first connection to you that hasn't triggered some mental
meltdown," says Haymitch. "It's something, at least,
Katniss."
My father. He seems to be everywhere today. Dying in
the mine. Singing his way into Peeta's muddled
consciousness. Flickering in the look Boggs gives me as
he protectively wraps the blanket around my shoulders. I
miss him so badly it hurts.
The gunfire's really picking up outside. Gale hurries by
with a group of rebels, eagerly headed for the battle. I don't
petition to join the fighters, not that they would let me. I have
no stomach for it anyway, no heat in my blood. I wish Peeta
was here--the old Peeta--because he would be able to
articulate why it is so wrong to be exchanging fire when
people, any people, are trying to claw their way out of the
mountain. Or is my own history making me too sensitive?
Aren't we at war? Isn't this just another way to kill our
enemies?
Night falls quickly. Huge, bright spotlights are turned
on, illuminating the square. Every bulb must be burning at
full wattage inside the train station as well. Even from my
position across the square, I can see clearly through the
plate-glass front of the long, narrow building. It would be
impossible to miss the arrival of a train, or even a single
person. But hours pass and no one comes. With each
minute, it becomes harder to imagine that anyone survived
the assault on the Nut.
It's well after midnight when Cressida comes to attach
a special microphone to my costume. "What's this for?" I
ask.
Haymitch's voice comes on to explain. "I know you're
not going to like this, but we need you to make a speech."
"A speech?" I say, immediately feeling queasy.
"I'll feed it to you, line by line," he assures me. "You'll
just have to repeat what I say. Look, there's no sign of life
from that mountain. We've won, but the fighting's continuing.
So we thought if you went out on the steps of the Justice
Building and laid it out--told everybody that the Nut's
defeated, that the Capitol's presence in District Two is
finished--you might be able to get the rest of their forces to
surrender."
I peer at the darkness beyond the square. "I can't even
see their forces."
"That's what the mike's for," he says. "You'll be
broadcast, both your voice through their emergency audio
system, and your image wherever people have access to a
screen."
I know there are a couple of huge screens here on the
square. I saw them on the Victory Tour. It might work, if I
were good at this sort of thing. Which I'm not. They tried to
feed me lines in those early experiments with the propos,
too, and it was a flop.
"You could save a lot of lives, Katniss," Haymitch says
finally.
"All right. I'll give it a try," I tell him.
It's strange standing outside at the top of the stairs,
fully costumed, brightly lit, but with no visible audience to
deliver my speech to. Like I'm doing a show for the moon.
"Let's make this quick," says Haymitch. "You're too
exposed."
My television crew, positioned out in the square with
special cameras, indicates that they're ready. I tell
Haymitch to go ahead, then click on my mike and listen
carefully to him dictate the first line of the speech. A huge
image of me lights up one of the screens over the square
as I begin. "People of District Two, this is Katniss
Everdeen speaking to you from the steps of your Justice
Building, where--"
The pair of trains comes screeching into the train
station side by side. As the doors slide open, people
tumble out in a cloud of smoke they've brought from the Nut.
They must have had at least an inkling of what would await
them at the square, because you can see them trying to act
evasively. Most of them flatten on the floor, and a spray of
bullets inside the station takes out the lights. They've come
armed, as Gale predicted, but they've come wounded as
well. The moans can be heard in the otherwise silent night
air.
Someone kills the lights on the stairs, leaving me in the
protection of shadow. A flame blooms inside the station--
one of the trains must actually be on fire--and a thick, black
smoke billows against the windows. Left with no choice, the
people begin to push out into the square, choking but
defiantly waving their guns. My eyes dart around the
rooftops that ring the square. Every one of them has been
fortified with rebel-manned machine gun nests. Moonlight
glints off oiled barrels.
A young man staggers out from the station, one hand
pressed against a bloody cloth at his cheek, the other
dragging a gun. When he trips and falls to his face, I see
the scorch marks down the back of his shirt, the red flesh
beneath. And suddenly, he's just another burn victim from a
mine accident.
My feet fly down the steps and I take off running for
him. "Stop!" I yell at the rebels. "Hold your fire!" The words
echo around the square and beyond as the mike amplifies
my voice. "Stop!" I'm nearing the young man, reaching
down to help him, when he drags himself up to his knees
and trains his gun on my head.
I instinctively back up a few steps, raise my bow over
my head to show my intention was harmless. Now that he
has both hands on his gun, I notice the ragged hole in his
cheek where something--falling stone maybe--punctured
the flesh. He smells of burning things, hair and meat and
fuel. His eyes are crazed with pain and fear.
"Freeze," Haymitch's voice whispers in my ear. I follow
his order, realizing that this is what all of District 2, all of
Panem maybe, must be seeing at the moment. The
Mockingjay at the mercy of a man with nothing to lose.
His garbled speech is barely comprehensible. "Give
me one reason I shouldn't shoot you."
The rest of the world recedes. There's only me looking
into the wretched eyes of the man from the Nut who asks for
one reason. Surely I should be able to come up with
thousands. But the words that make it to my lips are "I
can't."
Logically, the next thing that should happen is the man
pulling the trigger. But he's perplexed, trying to make sense
of my words. I experience my own confusion as I realize
what I've said is entirely true, and the noble impulse that
carried me across the square is replaced by despair. "I
can't. That's the problem, isn't it?" I lower my bow. "We blew
up your mine. You burned my district to the ground. We've
got every reason to kill each other. So do it. Make the
Capitol happy. I'm done killing their slaves for them." I drop
my bow on the ground and give it a nudge with my boot. It
slides across the stone and comes to rest at his knees.
"I'm not their slave," the man mutters.
"I am," I say. "That's why I killed Cato...and he killed
Thresh...and he killed Clove...and she tried to kill me. It just
goes around and around, and who wins? Not us. Not the
districts. Always the Capitol. But I'm tired of being a piece
in their Games."
Peeta. On the rooftop the night before our first Hunger
Games. He understood it all before we'd even set foot in
the arena. I hope he's watching now, that he remembers
that night as it happened, and maybe forgives me when I
die.
"Keep talking. Tell them about watching the mountain
go down," Haymitch insists.
"When I saw that mountain fall tonight, I
thought...they've done it again. Got me to kill you--the
people in the districts. But why did I do it? District Twelve
and District Two have no fight except the one the Capitol
gave us." The young man blinks at me uncomprehendingly.
I sink on my knees before him, my voice low and urgent.
"And why are you fighting with the rebels on the rooftops?
With Lyme, who was your victor? With people who were
your neighbors, maybe even your family?"
"I don't know," says the man. But he doesn't take his
gun off me.
I rise and turn slowly in a circle, addressing the
machine guns. "And you up there? I come from a mining
town. Since when do miners condemn other miners to that
kind of death, and then stand by to kill whoever manages to
crawl from the rubble?"
"Who is the enemy?" whispers Haymitch.
"These people"--I indicate the wounded bodies on the
square--"are not your enemy!" I whip back around to the
train station. "The rebels are not your enemy! We all have
one enemy, and it's the Capitol! This is our chance to put
an end to their power, but we need every district person to
do it!" The cameras are tight on me as I reach out my hands
to the man, to the wounded, to the reluctant rebels across
Panem. "Please! Join us!"
My words hang in the air. I look to the screen, hoping to
see them recording some wave of reconciliation going
through the crowd.
Instead I watch myself get shot on television.
16
"Always."
In the twilight of morphling, Peeta whispers the word
and I go searching for him. It's a gauzy, violet-tinted world,
with no hard edges, and many places to hide. I push
through cloud banks, follow faint tracks, catch the scent of
cinnamon, of dill. Once I feel his hand on my cheek and try
to trap it, but it dissolves like mist through my fingers.
When I finally begin to surface into the sterile hospital
room in 13, I remember. I was under the influence of sleep
syrup. My heel had been injured after I'd climbed out on a
branch over the electric fence and dropped back into 12.
Peeta had put me to bed and I had asked him to stay with
me as I was drifting off. He had whispered something I
couldn't quite catch. But some part of my brain had trapped
his single word of reply and let it swim up through my
dreams to taunt me now. "Always."
Morphling dulls the extremes of all emotions, so
instead of a stab of sorrow, I merely feel emptiness. A
hollow of dead brush where flowers used to bloom.
Unfortunately, there's not enough of the drug left in my veins
for me to ignore the pain in the left side of my body. That's
where the bullet hit. My hands fumble over the thick
bandages encasing my ribs and I wonder what I'm still
doing here.
It wasn't him, the man kneeling before me on the
square, the burned one from the Nut. He didn't pull the
trigger. It was someone farther back in the crowd. There
was less a sense of penetration than the feeling that I'd
been struck with a sledgehammer. Everything after the
moment of impact is confusion riddled with gunfire. I try to
sit up, but the only thing I manage is a moan.
The white curtain that divides my bed from the next
patient's whips back, and Johanna Mason stares down at
me. At first I feel threatened, because she attacked me in
the arena. I have to remind myself that she did it to save my
life. It was part of the rebel plot. But still, that doesn't mean
she doesn't despise me. Maybe her treatment of me was
all an act for the Capitol?
"I'm alive," I say rustily.
"No kidding, brainless." Johanna walks over and
plunks down on my bed, sending spikes of pain shooting
across my chest. When she grins at my discomfort, I know
we're not in for some warm reunion scene. "Still a little
sore?" With an expert hand, she quickly detaches the
morphling drip from my arm and plugs it into a socket taped
into the crook of her own. "They started cutting back my
supply a few days ago. Afraid I'm going to turn into one of
those freaks from Six. I've had to borrow from you when the
coast was clear. Didn't think you'd mind."
Mind? How can I mind when she was almost tortured
to death by Snow after the Quarter Quell? I have no right to
mind, and she knows it.
Johanna sighs as the morphling enters her
bloodstream. "Maybe they were onto something in Six.
Drug yourself out and paint flowers on your body. Not such
a bad life. Seemed happier than the rest of us, anyway."
In the weeks since I left 13, she's gained some weight
back. A soft down of hair has sprouted on her shaved head,
helping to hide some of the scars. But if she's siphoning off
my morphling, she's struggling.
"They've got this head doctor who comes around every
day. Supposed to be helping me recover. Like some guy
who's spent his life in this rabbit warren's going to fix me
up. Complete idiot. At least twenty times a session he
reminds me that I'm totally safe." I manage a smile. It's a
truly stupid thing to say, especially to a victor. As if such a
state of being ever existed, anywhere, for anyone. "How
about you, Mockingjay? You feel totally safe?"
"Oh, yeah. Right up until I got shot," I say.
"Please. That bullet never even touched you. Cinna
saw to that," she says.
I think of the layers of protective armor in my
Mockingjay outfit. But the pain came from somewhere.
"Broken ribs?"
"Not even. Bruised pretty good. The impact ruptured
your spleen. They couldn't repair it." She gives a dismissive
wave of her hand. "Don't worry, you don't need one. And if
you did, they'd find you one, wouldn't they? It's everybody's
job to keep you alive."
"Is that why you hate me?" I ask.
"Partly," she admits. "Jealousy is certainly involved. I
also think you're a little hard to swallow. With your tacky
romantic drama and your defender-of-the-helpless act. Only
it isn't an act, which makes you more unbearable. Please
feel free to take this personally."
"You should have been the Mockingjay. No one
would've had to feed you lines," I say.
"True. But no one likes me," she tells me.
"They trusted you, though. To get me out," I remind her.
"And they're afraid of you."
"Here, maybe. In the Capitol, you're the one they're
scared of now." Gale appears in the doorway, and Johanna
neatly unhooks herself and reattaches me to the morphling
drip. "Your cousin's not afraid of me," she says
confidentially. She scoots off my bed and crosses to the
door, nudging Gale's leg with her hip as she passes him.
"Are you, gorgeous?" We can hear her laughter as she
disappears down the hall.
I raise my eyebrows at him as he takes my hand.
"Terrified," he mouths. I laugh, but it turns into a wince.
"Easy." He strokes my face as the pain ebbs. "You've got
to stop running straight into trouble."
"I know. But someone blew up a mountain," I answer.
Instead of pulling back, he leans in closer, searching
my face. "You think I'm heartless."
"I know you're not. But I won't tell you it's okay," I say.
Now he draws back, almost impatiently. "Katniss, what
difference is there, really, between crushing our enemy in a
mine or blowing them out of the sky with one of Beetee's
arrows? The result is the same."
"I don't know. We were under attack in Eight, for one
thing. The hospital was under attack," I say.
"Yes, and those hoverplanes came from District Two,"
he says. "So, by taking them out, we prevented further
attacks."
"But that kind of thinking...you could turn it into an
argument for killing anyone at any time. You could justify
sending kids into the Hunger Games to prevent the districts
from getting out of line," I say.
"I don't buy that," he tells me.
"I do," I reply. "It must be those trips to the arena."
"Fine. We know how to disagree," he says. "We
always have. Maybe it's good. Between you and me, we've
got District Two now."
"Really?" For a moment a feeling of triumph flares up
inside me. Then I think about the people on the square.
"Was there fighting after I was shot?"
"Not much. The workers from the Nut turned on the
Capitol soldiers. The rebels just sat by and watched," he
says. "Actually, the whole country just sat by and watched."
"Well, that's what they do best," I say.
You'd think that losing a major organ would entitle you
to lie around a few weeks, but for some reason, my doctors
want me up and moving almost immediately. Even with the
morphling, the internal pain's severe the first few days, but
then it slacks off considerably. The soreness from the
bruised ribs, however, promises to hang on for a while. I
begin to resent Johanna dipping into my morphling supply,
but I still let her take whatever she likes.
Rumors of my death have been running rampant, so
they send in the team to film me in my hospital bed. I show
off my stitches and impressive bruising and congratulate
the districts on their successful battle for unity. Then I warn
the Capitol to expect us soon.
As part of my rehabilitation, I take short walks
aboveground each day. One afternoon, Plutarch joins me
and gives me an update on our current situation. Now that
District 2 has allied with us, the rebels are taking a breather
from the war to regroup. Fortifying supply lines, seeing to
the wounded, reorganizing their troops. The Capitol, like 13
during the Dark Days, finds itself completely cut off from
outside help as it holds the threat of nuclear attack over its
enemies. Unlike 13, the Capitol is not in a position to
reinvent itself and become self-sufficient.
"Oh, the city might be able to scrape along for a while,"
says Plutarch. "Certainly, there are emergency supplies
stockpiled. But the significant difference between Thirteen
and the Capitol are the expectations of the populace.
Thirteen was used to hardship, whereas in the Capitol, all
they've known is Panem et Circenses."
"What's that?" I recognize Panem, of course, but the
rest is nonsense.
"It's a saying from thousands of years ago, written in a
language called Latin about a place called Rome," he
explains. "Panem et Circenses translates into 'Bread and
Circuses.' The writer was saying that in return for full bellies
and entertainment, his people had given up their political
responsibilities and therefore their power."
I think about the Capitol. The excess of food. And the
ultimate entertainment. The Hunger Games. "So that's what
the districts are for. To provide the bread and circuses."
"Yes. And as long as that kept rolling in, the Capitol
could control its little empire. Right now, it can provide
neither, at least at the standard the people are accustomed
to," says Plutarch. "We have the food and I'm about to
orchestrate an entertainment propo that's sure to be
popular. After all, everybody loves a wedding."
I freeze in my tracks, sick at the idea of what he's
suggesting. Somehow staging some perverse wedding
between Peeta and me. I haven't been able to face that
one-way glass since I've been back and, at my own
request, only get updates about Peeta's condition from
Haymitch. He speaks very little about it. Different
techniques are being tried. There will never truly be a way
to cure him. And now they want me to marry Peeta for a
propo?
Plutarch rushes to reassure me. "Oh, no, Katniss. Not
your wedding. Finnick and Annie's. All you need to do is
show up and pretend to be happy for them."
"That's one of the few things I won't have to pretend,
Plutarch," I tell him.
The next few days bring a flurry of activity as the event
is planned. The differences between the Capitol and 13 are
thrown into sharp relief by the event. When Coin says
"wedding," she means two people signing a piece of paper
and being assigned a new compartment. Plutarch means
hundreds of people dressed in finery at a three-day
celebration. It's amusing to watch them haggle over the
details. Plutarch has to fight for every guest, every musical
note. After Coin vetoes a dinner, entertainment, and
alcohol, Plutarch yells, "What's the point of the propo if no
one's having any fun!"
It's hard to put a Gamemaker on a budget. But even a
quiet celebration causes a stir in 13, where they seem to
have no holidays at all. When it's announced that children
are wanted to sing District 4's wedding song, practically
every kid shows up. There's no shortage of volunteers to
help make decorations. In the dining hall, people chat
excitedly about the event.
Maybe it's more than the festivities. Maybe it's that we
are all so starved for something good to happen that we
want to be part of it. It would explain why--when Plutarch has
a fit over what the bride will wear--I volunteer to take Annie
back to my house in 12, where Cinna left a variety of
evening clothes in a big storage closet downstairs. All of
the wedding gowns he designed for me went back to the
Capitol, but there are some dresses I wore on the Victory
Tour. I'm a little leery about being with Annie since all I really
know about her is that Finnick loves her and everybody
thinks she's mad. On the hovercraft ride, I decide she's less
mad than unstable. She laughs at odd places in the
conversation or drops out of it distractedly. Those green
eyes fixate on a point with such intensity that you find
yourself trying to make out what she sees in the empty air.
Sometimes, for no reason, she presses both her hands
over her ears as if to block out a painful sound. All right,
she's strange, but if Finnick loves her, that's good enough
for me.
I got permission for my prep team to come along, so
I'm relieved of having to make any fashion decisions. When
I open the closet, we all fall silent because Cinna's
presence is so strong in the flow of the fabrics. Then
Octavia drops to her knees, rubs the hem of a skirt against
her cheek, and bursts into tears. "It's been so long," she
gasps, "since I've seen anything pretty."
Despite reservations on Coin's side that it's too
extravagant, and on Plutarch's side that it's too drab, the
wedding is a smash hit. The three hundred lucky guests
culled from 13 and the many refugees wear their everyday
clothes, the decorations are made from autumn foliage, the
music is provided by a choir of children accompanied by
the lone fiddler who made it out of 12 with his instrument.
So it's simple, frugal by the Capitol's standards. It doesn't
matter because nothing can compete with the beauty of the
couple. It isn't about their borrowed finery--Annie wears a
green silk dress I wore in 5, Finnick one of Peeta's suits
that they altered--although the clothes are striking. Who can
look past the radiant faces of two people for whom this day
was once a virtual impossibility? Dalton, the cattle guy from
10, conducts the ceremony, since it's similar to the one
used in his district. But there are unique touches of District
4. A net woven from long grass that covers the couple
during their vows, the touching of each other's lips with salt
water, and the ancient wedding song, which likens
marriage to a sea voyage.
No, I don't have to pretend to be happy for them.
After the kiss that seals the union, the cheers, and a
toast with apple cider, the fiddler strikes up a tune that turns
every head from 12. We may have been the smallest,
poorest district in Panem, but we know how to dance.
Nothing has been officially scheduled at this point, but
Plutarch, who's calling the propo from the control room,
must have his fingers crossed. Sure enough, Greasy Sae
grabs Gale by the hand and pulls him into the center of the
floor and faces off with him. People pour in to join them,
forming two long lines. And the dancing begins.
I'm standing off to the side, clapping to the rhythm,
when a bony hand pinches me above the elbow. Johanna
scowls at me. "Are you going to miss the chance to let
Snow see you dancing?" She's right. What could spell
victory louder than a happy Mockingjay twirling around to
music? I find Prim in the crowd. Since winter evenings gave
us a lot of time to practice, we're actually pretty good
partners. I brush off her concerns about my ribs, and we
take our places in the line. It hurts, but the satisfaction of
having Snow watch me dance with my little sister reduces
other feelings to dust.
Dancing transforms us. We teach the steps to the
District 13 guests. Insist on a special number for the bride
and groom. Join hands and make a giant, spinning circle
where people show off their footwork. Nothing silly, joyful, or
fun has happened in so long. This could go on all night if not
for the last event planned in Plutarch's propo. One I hadn't
heard about, but then it was meant to be a surprise.
Four people wheel out a huge wedding cake from a
side room. Most of the guests back up, making way for this
rarity, this dazzling creation with blue-green, white-tipped
icing waves swimming with fish and sailboats, seals and
sea flowers. But I push my way through the crowd to confirm
what I knew at first sight. As surely as the embroidery
stitches in Annie's gown were done by Cinna's hand, the
frosted flowers on the cake were done by Peeta's.
This may seem like a small thing, but it speaks
volumes. Haymitch has been keeping a great deal from
me. The boy I last saw, screaming his head off, trying to
tear free of his restraints, could never have made this.
Never have had the focus, kept his hands steady, designed
something so perfect for Finnick and Annie. As if
anticipating my reaction, Haymitch is at my side.
"Let's you and me have a talk," he says.
Out in the hall, away from the cameras, I ask, "What's
happening to him?"
Haymitch shakes his head. "I don't know. None of us
knows. Sometimes he's almost rational, and then, for no
reason, he goes off again. Doing the cake was a kind of
therapy. He's been working on it for days. Watching
him...he seemed almost like before."
"So, he's got the run of the place?" I ask. The idea
makes me nervous on about five different levels.
"Oh, no. He frosted under heavy guard. He's still under
lock and key. But I've talked to him," Haymitch says.
"Face-to-face?" I ask. "And he didn't go nuts?"
"No. Pretty angry with me, but for all the right reasons.
Not telling him about the rebel plot and whatnot." Haymitch
pauses a moment, as if deciding something. "He says he'd
like to see you."
I'm on a frosting sailboat, tossed around by blue-green
waves, the deck shifting beneath my feet. My palms press
into the wall to steady myself. This wasn't part of the plan. I
wrote Peeta off in 2. Then I was to go to the Capitol, kill
Snow, and get taken out myself. The gunshot was only a
temporary setback. Never was I supposed to hear the
words He says he'd like to see you. But now that I have,
there's no way to refuse.
At midnight, I'm standing outside the door to his cell.
Hospital room. We had to wait for Plutarch to finish getting
his wedding footage, which, despite the lack of what he
calls razzle-dazzle, he's pleased with. "The best thing about
the Capitol basically ignoring Twelve all these years is that
you people still have a little spontaneity. The audience eats
that up. Like when Peeta announced he was in love with
you or you did the trick with the berries. Makes for good
television."
I wish I could meet with Peeta privately. But the
audience of doctors has assembled behind the one-way
glass, clipboards ready, pens poised. When Haymitch
gives me the okay in my earpiece, I slowly open the door.
Those blue eyes lock on me instantly. He's got three
restraints on each arm, and a tube that can dispense a
knockout drug just in case he loses control. He doesn't fight
to free himself, though, only observes me with the wary look
of someone who still hasn't ruled out that he's in the
presence of a mutt. I walk over until I'm standing about a
yard from the bed. There's nothing to do with my hands, so I
cross my arms protectively over my ribs before I speak.
"Hey."
"Hey," he responds. It's like his voice, almost his voice,
except there's something new in it. An edge of suspicion
and reproach.
"Haymitch said you wanted to talk to me," I say.
"Look at you, for starters." It's like he's waiting for me
to transform into a hybrid drooling wolf right before his
eyes. He stares so long I find myself casting furtive glances
at the one-way glass, hoping for some direction from
Haymitch, but my earpiece stays silent. "You're not very big,
are you? Or particularly pretty?"
I know he's been through hell and back, and yet
somehow the observation rubs me the wrong way. "Well,
you've looked better."
Haymitch's advice to back off gets muffled by Peeta's
laughter. "And not even remotely nice. To say that to me
after all I've been through."
"Yeah. We've all been through a lot. And you're the one
who was known for being nice. Not me." I'm doing
everything wrong. I don't know why I feel so defensive. He's
been tortured! He's been hijacked! What's wrong with me?
Suddenly, I think I might start screaming at him--I'm not even
sure about what--so I decide to get out of there. "Look, I
don't feel so well. Maybe I'll drop by tomorrow."
I've just reached the door when his voice stops me.
"Katniss. I remember about the bread."
The bread. Our one moment of real connection before
the Hunger Games.
"They showed you the tape of me talking about it," I
say.
"No. Is there a tape of you talking about it? Why didn't
the Capitol use it against me?" he asks.
"I made it the day you were rescued," I answer. The
pain in my chest wraps around my ribs like a vise. The
dancing was a mistake. "So what do you remember?"
"You. In the rain," he says softly. "Digging in our trash
bins. Burning the bread. My mother hitting me. Taking the
bread out for the pig but then giving it to you instead."
"That's it. That's what happened," I say. "The next day,
after school, I wanted to thank you. But I didn't know how."
"We were outside at the end of the day. I tried to catch
your eye. You looked away. And then...for some reason, I
think you picked a dandelion." I nod. He does remember. I
have never spoken about that moment aloud. "I must have
loved you a lot."
"You did." My voice catches and I pretend to cough.
"And did you love me?" he asks.
I keep my eyes on the tiled floor. "Everyone says I did.
Everyone says that's why Snow had you tortured. To break
me."
"That's not an answer," he tells me. "I don't know what
to think when they show me some of the tapes. In that first
arena, it looked like you tried to kill me with those tracker
jackers."
"I was trying to kill all of you," I say. "You had me treed."
"Later, there's a lot of kissing. Didn't seem very
genuine on your part. Did you like kissing me?" he asks.
"Sometimes," I admit. "You know people are watching
us now?"
"I know. What about Gale?" he continues.
My anger's returning. I don't care about his recovery--
this isn't the business of the people behind the glass. "He's
not a bad kisser either," I say shortly.
"And it was okay with both of us? You kissing the
other?" he asks.
"No. It wasn't okay with either of you. But I wasn't
asking your permission," I tell him.
Peeta laughs again, coldly, dismissively. "Well, you're
a piece of work, aren't you?"
Haymitch doesn't protest when I walk out. Down the
hall. Through the beehive of compartments. Find a warm
pipe to hide behind in a laundry room. It takes a long time
before I get to the bottom of why I'm so upset. When I do,
it's almost too mortifying to admit. All those months of
taking it for granted that Peeta thought I was wonderful are
over. Finally, he can see me for who I really am. Violent.
Distrustful. Manipulative. Deadly.
And I hate him for it.
17
Blindsided. That's how I feel when Haymitch tells me in
the hospital. I fly down the steps to Command, mind racing
a mile a minute, and burst right into a war meeting.
"What do you mean, I'm not going to the Capitol? I
have to go! I'm the Mockingjay!" I say.
Coin barely looks up from her screen. "And as the
Mockingjay, your primary goal of unifying the districts
against the Capitol has been achieved. Don't worry--if it
goes well, we'll fly you in for the surrender."
The surrender?
"That'll be too late! I'll miss all the fighting. You need
me--I'm the best shot you've got!" I shout. I don't usually
brag about this, but it's got to be at least close to true.
"Gale's going."
"Gale has shown up for training every day unless
occupied with other approved duties. We feel confident he
can manage himself in the field," says Coin. "How many
training sessions do you estimate you've attended?"
None. That's how many. "Well, sometimes I was
hunting. And...I trained with Beetee down in Special
Weaponry."
"It's not the same, Katniss," says Boggs. "We all know
you're smart and brave and a good shot. But we need
soldiers in the field. You don't know the first thing about
executing orders, and you're not exactly at your physical
peak."
"That didn't bother you when I was in Eight. Or Two, for
that matter," I counter.
"You weren't originally authorized for combat in either
case," says Plutarch, shooting me a look that signals I'm
about to reveal too much.
No, the bomber battle in 8 and my intervention in 2
were spontaneous, rash, and definitely unauthorized.
"And both resulted in your injury," Boggs reminds me.
Suddenly, I see myself through his eyes. A smallish
seventeen-year-old girl who can't quite catch her breath
since her ribs haven't fully healed. Disheveled.
Undisciplined. Recuperating. Not a soldier, but someone
who needs to be looked after.
"But I have to go," I say.
"Why?" asks Coin.
I can't very well say it's so I can carry out my own
personal vendetta against Snow. Or that the idea of
remaining here in 13 with the latest version of Peeta while
Gale goes off to fight is unbearable. But I have no shortage
of reasons to want to fight in the Capitol. "Because of
Twelve. Because they destroyed my district."
The president thinks about this a moment. Considers
me. "Well, you have three weeks. It's not long, but you can
begin training. If the Assignment Board deems you fit,
possibly your case will be reviewed."
That's it. That's the most I can hope for. I guess it's my
own fault. I did blow off my schedule every single day unless
something suited me. It didn't seem like much of a priority,
jogging around a field with a gun with so many other things
going on. And now I'm paying for my negligence.
Back in the hospital, I find Johanna in the same
circumstance and spitting mad. I tell her about what Coin
said. "Maybe you can train, too."
"Fine. I'll train. But I'm going to the stinking Capitol if I
have to kill a crew and fly there myself," says Johanna.
"Probably best not to bring that up in training," I say.
"But it's nice to know I'll have a ride."
Johanna grins, and I feel a slight but significant shift in
our relationship. I don't know that we're actually friends, but
possibly the word allies would be accurate. That's good. I'm
going to need an ally.
The next morning, when we report for training at 7:30,
reality slaps me in the face. We've been funneled into a
class of relative beginners, fourteen- or fifteen-year-olds,
which seems a little insulting until it's obvious that they're in
far better condition than we are. Gale and the other people
already chosen to go to the Capitol are in a different,
accelerated phase of training. After we stretch--which hurts-
-there's a couple of hours of strengthening exercises--which
hurt--and a five-mile run--which kills. Even with Johanna's
motivational insults driving me on, I have to drop out after a
mile.
"It's my ribs," I explain to the trainer, a no-nonsense
middle-aged woman we're supposed to address as
Soldier York. "They're still bruised."
"Well, I'll tell you, Soldier Everdeen, those are going to
take at least another month to heal up on their own," she
says.I shake my head. "I don't have a month."
She looks me up and down. "The doctors haven't
offered you any treatment?"
"Is there a treatment?" I ask. "They said they had to
mend naturally."
"That's what they say. But they could speed up the
process if I recommend it. I warn you, though, it isn't any
fun," she tells me.
"Please. I've got to get to the Capitol," I say.
Soldier York doesn't question this. She scribbles
something on a pad and sends me directly back to the
hospital. I hesitate. I don't want to miss any more training.
"I'll be back for the afternoon session," I promise. She just
purses her lips.
Twenty-four needle jabs to my rib cage later, I'm
flattened out on my hospital bed, gritting my teeth to keep
from begging them to bring back my morphling drip. It's
been by my bed so I can take a hit as needed. I haven't
used it lately, but I kept it for Johanna's sake. Today they
tested my blood to make sure it was clean of the painkiller,
as the mixture of the two drugs--the morphling and
whatever's set my ribs on fire--has dangerous side effects.
They made it clear I would have a difficult couple of days.
But I told them to go ahead.
It's a bad night in our room. Sleep's out of the question.
I think I can actually smell the ring of flesh around my chest
burning, and Johanna's fighting off withdrawal symptoms.
Early on, when I apologize about cutting off her morphling
supply, she waves it off, saying it had to happen anyway.
But by three in the morning, I'm the target of every colorful
bit of profanity District 7 has to offer. At dawn, she drags
me out of bed, determined to get to training.
"I don't think I can do it," I confess.
"You can do it. We both can. We're victors,
remember? We're the ones who can survive anything they
throw at us," she snarls at me. She's a sick greenish color,
shaking like a leaf. I get dressed.
We must be victors to make it through the morning. I
think I'm going to lose Johanna when we realize it's pouring
outside. Her face turns ashen and she seems to have
ceased breathing.
"It's just water. It won't kill us," I say. She clenches her
jaw and stomps out into the mud. Rain drenches us as we
work our bodies and then slog around the running course. I
bail after a mile again, and I have to resist the temptation to
take off my shirt so the cold water can sizzle off my ribs. I
force down my field lunch of soggy fish and beet stew.
Johanna gets halfway through her bowl before it comes
back up. In the afternoon, we learn to assemble our guns. I
manage it, but Johanna can't hold her hands steady enough
to fit the parts together. When York's back is turned, I help
her out. Even though the rain continues, the afternoon's an
improvement because we're on the shooting range. At last,
something I'm good at. It takes some adjusting from a bow
to a gun, but by the end of the day, I've got the best score in
my class.
We're just inside the hospital doors when Johanna
declares, "This has to stop. Us living in the hospital.
Everyone views us as patients."
It's not a problem for me. I can move into our family
compartment, but Johanna's never been assigned one.
When she tries to get discharged from the hospital, they
won't agree to let her live alone, even if she comes in for
daily talks with the head doctor. I think they may have put
two and two together about the morphling and this only
adds to their view that she's unstable. "She won't be alone.
I'm going to room with her," I announce. There's some
dissent, but Haymitch takes our part, and by bedtime, we
have a compartment across from Prim and my mother, who
agrees to keep an eye on us.
After I take a shower, and Johanna sort of wipes
herself down with a damp cloth, she makes a cursory
inspection of the place. When she opens the drawer that
holds my few possessions, she shuts it quickly. "Sorry."
I think how there's nothing in Johanna's drawer but her
government-issued clothes. That she doesn't have one
thing in the world to call her own. "It's okay. You can look at
my stuff if you want."
Johanna unlatches my locket, studying the pictures of
Gale, Prim, and my mother. She opens the silver parachute
and pulls out the spile and slips it onto her pinkie. "Makes
me thirsty just looking at it." Then she finds the pearl Peeta
gave me. "Is this--?"
"Yeah," I say. "Made it through somehow." I don't want
to talk about Peeta. One of the best things about training is,
it keeps me from thinking of him.
"Haymitch says he's getting better," she says.
"Maybe. But he's changed," I say.
"So have you. So have I. And Finnick and Haymitch
and Beetee. Don't get me started on Annie Cresta. The
arena messed us all up pretty good, don't you think? Or do
you still feel like the girl who volunteered for your sister?"
she asks me.
"No," I answer.
"That's the one thing I think my head doctor might be
right about. There's no going back. So we might as well get
on with things." She neatly returns my keepsakes to the
drawer and climbs into the bed across from me just as the
lights go out. "You're not afraid I'll kill you tonight?"
"Like I couldn't take you," I answer. Then we laugh,
since both our bodies are so wrecked, it will be a miracle if
we can get up the next day. But we do. Each morning, we
do. And by the end of the week, my ribs feel almost like
new, and Johanna can assemble her rifle without help.
Soldier York gives the pair of us an approving nod as
we knock off for the day. "Fine job, Soldiers."
When we move out of hearing, Johanna mutters, "I
think winning the Games was easier." But the look on her
face says she's pleased.
In fact, we're almost in good spirits when we go to the
dining hall, where Gale's waiting to eat with me. Receiving
a giant serving of beef stew doesn't hurt my mood either.
"First shipments of food arrived this morning," Greasy Sae
tells me. "That's real beef, from District Ten. Not any of your
wild dog."
"Don't remember you turning it down," Gale tosses
back. We join a group that includes Delly, Annie, and
Finnick. It's something to see Finnick's transformation since
his marriage. His earlier incarnations--the decadent Capitol
heartthrob I met before the Quell, the enigmatic ally in the
arena, the broken young man who tried to help me hold it
together--these have been replaced by someone who
radiates life. Finnick's real charms of self-effacing humor
and an easygoing nature are on display for the first time.
He never lets go of Annie's hand. Not when they walk, not
when they eat. I doubt he ever plans to. She's lost in some
daze of happiness. There are still moments when you can
tell something slips in her brain and another world blinds
her to us. But a few words from Finnick call her back.
Delly, who I've known since I was little but never gave
much thought to, has grown in my estimation. She was told
what Peeta said to me that night after the wedding, but
she's not a gossip. Haymitch says she's the best defender I
have when Peeta goes off on some kind of tear about me.
Always taking my side, blaming his negative perceptions
on the Capitol's torture. She has more influence on him than
any of the others do, because he really does know her.
Anyway, even if she's sugarcoating my good points, I
appreciate it. Frankly, I could use a little sugarcoating.
I'm starving and the stew is so delicious--beef,
potatoes, turnips, and onions in a thick gravy--that I have to
force myself to slow down. All around the dining hall, you
can feel the rejuvenating effect that a good meal can bring
on. The way it can make people kinder, funnier, more
optimistic, and remind them it's not a mistake to go on
living. It's better than any medicine. So I try to make it last
and join in the conversation. Sop up the gravy on my bread
and nibble on it as I listen to Finnick telling some ridiculous
story about a sea turtle swimming off with his hat. Laugh
before I realize he's standing there. Directly across the
table, behind the empty seat next to Johanna. Watching
me. I choke momentarily as the gravy bread sticks in my
throat.
"Peeta!" says Delly. "It's so nice to see you out...and
about."
Two large guards stand behind him. He holds his tray
awkwardly, balanced on his fingertips since his wrists are
shackled with a short chain between them.
"What's with the fancy bracelets?" asks Johanna.
"I'm not quite trustworthy yet," says Peeta. "I can't even
sit here without your permission." He indicates the guards
with his head.
"Sure he can sit here. We're old friends," says
Johanna, patting the space beside her. The guards nod
and Peeta takes a seat. "Peeta and I had adjoining cells in
the Capitol. We're very familiar with each other's screams."
Annie, who's on Johanna's other side, does that thing
where she covers her ears and exits reality. Finnick shoots
Johanna an angry look as his arm encircles Annie.
"What? My head doctor says I'm not supposed to
censor my thoughts. It's part of my therapy," replies
Johanna.
The life has gone out of our little party. Finnick
murmurs things to Annie until she slowly removes her
hands. Then there's a long silence while people pretend to
eat.
"Annie," says Delly brightly, "did you know it was
Peeta who decorated your wedding cake? Back home, his
family ran the bakery and he did all the icing."
Annie cautiously looks across Johanna. "Thank you,
Peeta. It was beautiful."
"My pleasure, Annie," says Peeta, and I hear that old
note of gentleness in his voice that I thought was gone
forever. Not that it's directed at me. But still.
"If we're going to fit in that walk, we better go," Finnick
tells her. He arranges both of their trays so he can carry
them in one hand while holding tightly to her with the other.
"Good seeing you, Peeta."
"You be nice to her, Finnick. Or I might try and take her
away from you." It could be a joke, if the tone wasn't so
cold. Everything it conveys is wrong. The open distrust of
Finnick, the implication that Peeta has his eye on Annie,
that Annie could desert Finnick, that I do not even exist.
"Oh, Peeta," says Finnick lightly. "Don't make me sorry
I restarted your heart." He leads Annie away after giving me
a concerned glance.
When they're gone, Delly says in a reproachful voice,
"He did save your life, Peeta. More than once."
"For her." He gives me a brief nod. "For the rebellion.
Not for me. I don't owe him anything."
I shouldn't rise to the bait, but I do. "Maybe not. But
Mags is dead and you're still here. That should count for
something."
"Yeah, a lot of things should count for something that
don't seem to, Katniss. I've got some memories I can't
make sense of, and I don't think the Capitol touched them.
A lot of nights on the train, for instance," he says.
Again the implications. That more happened on the
train than did. That what did happen--those nights I only
kept my sanity because his arms were around me--no
longer matters. Everything a lie, everything a way of
misusing him.
Peeta makes a little gesture with his spoon,
connecting Gale and me. "So, are you two officially a
couple now, or are they still dragging out the star-crossed
lover thing?"
"Still dragging," says Johanna.
Spasms cause Peeta's hands to tighten into fists, then
splay out in a bizarre fashion. Is it all he can do to keep
them from my neck? I can feel the tension in Gale's muscles
next to me, fear an altercation. But Gale simply says, "I
wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself."
"What's that?" asks Peeta.
"You," Gale answers.
"You'll have to be a little more specific," says Peeta.
"What about me?"
"That they've replaced you with the evil-mutt version of
yourself," says Johanna.
Gale finishes his milk. "You done?" he asks me. I rise
and we cross to drop off our trays. At the door, an old man
stops me because I'm still clutching the rest of my gravy
bread in my hand. Something in my expression, or maybe
the fact that I've made no attempt to conceal it, makes him
go easy on me. He lets me stuff the bread in my mouth and
move on. Gale and I are almost to my compartment when
he speaks again. "I didn't expect that."
"I told you he hated me," I say.
"It's the way he hates you. It's so...familiar. I used to feel
like that," he admits. "When I'd watch you kissing him on the
screen. Only I knew I wasn't being entirely fair. He can't see
that."
We reach my door. "Maybe he just sees me as I really
am. I have to get some sleep."
Gale catches my arm before I can disappear. "So
that's what you're thinking now?" I shrug. "Katniss, as your
oldest friend, believe me when I say he's not seeing you as
you really are." He kisses my cheek and goes.
I sit on my bed, trying to stuff information from my
Military Tactics books into my head while memories of my
nights with Peeta on the train distract me. After about
twenty minutes, Johanna comes in and throws herself
across the foot of my bed. "You missed the best part. Delly
lost her temper at Peeta over how he treated you. She got
very squeaky. It was like someone stabbing a mouse with a
fork repeatedly. The whole dining hall was riveted."
"What'd Peeta do?" I ask.
"He started arguing with himself like he was two
people. The guards had to take him away. On the good
side, no one seemed to notice I finished his stew." Johanna
rubs her hand over her protruding belly. I look at the layer of
grime under her fingernails. Wonder if the people in 7 ever
bathe. We spend a couple of hours quizzing each other on
military terms. I visit my mother and Prim for a while. When
I'm back in my compartment, showered, staring into the
darkness, I finally ask, "Johanna, could you really hear him
screaming?"
"That was part of it," she says. "Like the jabberjays in
the arena. Only it was real. And it didn't stop after an hour.
Tick, tock."
"Tick, tock," I whisper back.
Roses. Wolf mutts. Tributes. Frosted dolphins.
Friends. Mockingjays. Stylists. Me.
Everything screams in my dreams tonight.

I throw myself into training with a vengeance. Eat, live,
and breathe the workouts, drills, weapons practice, lectures
on tactics. A handful of us are moved into an additional
class that gives me hope I may be a contender for the
actual war. The soldiers simply call it the Block, but the
tattoo on my arm lists it as S.S.C., short for Simulated
Street Combat. Deep in 13, they've built an artificial Capitol
city block. The instructor breaks us into squads of eight and
we attempt to carry out missions--gaining a position,
destroying a target, searching a home--as if we were really
fighting our way through the Capitol. The thing's rigged so
that everything that can go wrong for you does. A false step
triggers a land mine, a sniper appears on a rooftop, your
gun jams, a crying child leads you into an ambush, your
squadron leader--who's just a voice on the program--gets
hit by a mortar and you have to figure out what to do without
orders. Part of you knows it's fake and that they're not going
to kill you. If you set off a land mine, you hear the explosion
and have to pretend to fall over dead. But in other ways, it
feels pretty real in there--the enemy soldiers dressed in
Peacekeepers' uniforms, the confusion of a smoke bomb.
They even gas us. Johanna and I are the only ones who get
our masks on in time. The rest of our squad gets knocked
out for ten minutes. And the supposedly harmless gas I took
a few lungfuls of gives me a wicked headache for the rest
of the day.
